          <Sync id="L167"time="00:26:24"/>Yes. <Sync id="L168"time="00:26:24"/>That will be from Katy Huberty with Morgan Stanley.

Kathryn Lynn Huberty,  Morgan Stanley, Research Division - MD and Research Analyst    [2]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          <Sync id="L169"time="00:26:30"/>Tim, in light of the economic adversity that you talked about in the prepared remarks, can you just walk us through how Apple's leveraging finance and trade-in programs to make technology more affordable and accessible during this period while also addressing the opportunity to recycle and reuse products and maybe also extend that to how these programs might expand over time? <Sync id="L170"time="00:26:56"/>And then I have a follow-up.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Timothy D. Cook,  Apple Inc. - CEO & Director    [3]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          <Sync id="L171"time="00:26:59"/>As Luca mentioned, in June, we actually rolled out to the overwhelming balance of our other products the ability to do interest rate -- interest-free financing in our stores with payments. <Sync id="L172"time="00:27:15"/>And that's in addition to trade-in, which is becoming a more common trend now, which I think is terrific because it is great for the environment and it acts as a subsidy, if you will, against the price of a new phone. <Sync id="L173"time="00:27:35"/>And so when you compound these 2 things with the financing and the trade-in, it makes the product super affordable. <Sync id="L174"time="00:27:45"/>And we're really happy with what we're seeing in that regard.

          <Sync id="L175"time="00:27:52"/>And then as a follow-up, just specifically to iPhone, the category returned to growth. <Sync id="L176"time="00:27:56"/>As you pointed out, the installed base is larger today. <Sync id="L177"time="00:28:02"/>Our math would suggest that replacement cycles, in some cases, are elongated. <Sync id="L178"time="00:28:07"/>And then you have the affordability element that you just discussed. <Sync id="L179"time="00:28:10"/>Does all of that combine to build confidence that we're entering a longer period of iPhone revenue growth after what's been 6 quarters of decline?

Timothy D. Cook,  Apple Inc. - CEO & Director    [5]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          <Sync id="L180"time="00:28:24"/>We're very pleased with how we did on iPhone. <Sync id="L181"time="00:28:26"/>It was better than we thought largely because, as we pointed out in the prepared remarks, May and June were much better. <Sync id="L182"time="00:28:37"/>If you look at iPhone in totality, the things that get me very optimistic is the size of the active installed base. <Sync id="L183"time="00:28:47"/>The fact that if you look in the major geographies like the U.S., we had the top 2 selling smartphones. <Sync id="L184"time="00:28:54"/>In the U.K., we had 3 of the top 4. In Australia, we had 5 of the top 6. And in Japan, we had the top 4. Urban China, we were -- iPhone 11 was the top-selling smartphone in the country. <Sync id="L185"time="00:29:09"/>And so these are some very different geographies with very different competitive situations and we're doing fairly well. 
<Sync id="L186"time="00:29:18"/>The iPhone SE, it's also clear that from the early data, we're seeing a higher switcher number than we did in the previous year, which we feel very good about. <Sync id="L187"time="00:29:30"/>And it also seemed to appeal to some people that were holding onto the device a little longer because they wanted a smaller form factor phone. <Sync id="L188"time="00:29:39"/>And so the combination of the smaller form factor and an incredibly affordable price made the iPhone SE very popular. <Sync id="L189"time="00:29:49"/>iPhone 11 is still the most popular smartphone, but iPhone SE definitely helped our results. <Sync id="L190"time="00:29:57"/>And as we -- as Lucas said in his outlook, we do see that continuing into this quarter currently.

          <Sync id="L192"time="00:30:16"/>I have 2 of them. <Sync id="L193"time="00:30:20"/>First one, Tim, when you look at the Services business and in terms of your TV+ content production, have the movement restrictions impacted the content production efforts? <Sync id="L194"time="00:30:33"/>And along the same path, 4 years ago, your premonition on Services being a $50 billion business in 2020 came sooner than expected. <Sync id="L195"time="00:30:42"/>I don't know if you want to make any such forecast 4 years out on how you think Services revenue is going to be. <Sync id="L196"time="00:30:47"/>Then I had a follow-up for Luca.

          <Sync id="L197"time="00:30:50"/>I'm sorry. <Sync id="L198"time="00:30:50"/>I missed that second question because the audio didn't come through. <Sync id="L199"time="00:30:53"/>But I think I got to -- just to the first, and that is production has been affected for Apple TV+, as I think it has for most people. <Sync id="L200"time="00:31:06"/>We are working to get restarted. <Sync id="L201"time="00:31:09"/>I don't have a precise date yet when we will get restarted, but there will be some impact because we shut down in the March time frame and are yet to really restart in a significant way particularly for those that are shot in the L.A. area given the current status of the virus in this -- and I'm sorry, I missed your -- the second part of your question.

          <Sync id="L202"time="00:31:38"/>Well, Tim, I was trying to see. <Sync id="L203"time="00:31:42"/>4 years ago, you made a great prediction that Services is going to be $50 billion by 2020. <Sync id="L204"time="00:31:48"/>I wanted to see if you have any update to the prediction 4 years down the road.

          <Sync id="L205"time="00:31:53"/>We're not updating today. <Sync id="L206"time="00:31:55"/>We feel good. <Sync id="L207"time="00:31:56"/>We want to take the moment and feel good about achieving the doubling 6 months early. <Sync id="L208"time="00:32:04"/>And we do have, still hanging out there, as you know, the subscription number that we're shooting for later in the year at 600 million. <Sync id="L209"time="00:32:15"/>So we do have that objective out there.

          <Sync id="L210"time="00:32:20"/>Okay. <Sync id="L211"time="00:32:21"/>If I could just squeeze in one for Luca. <Sync id="L212"time="00:32:23"/>With the strong sales in Mac given the shelter in place, do you think the back-to-school season got pulled in by a quarter? <Sync id="L213"time="00:32:30"/>Or do you expect the momentum to still continue?

Luca Maestri,  Apple Inc. - CFO & Senior VP    [12]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          <Sync id="L214"time="00:32:34"/>As I said when I was talking about providing some commentary for the September quarter, we expect all the non-iPhone product categories to have a very strong year-over-year performance. <Sync id="L215"time="00:32:48"/>So we definitely -- I mean the back-to-school season is clearly this one. <Sync id="L216"time="00:32:54"/>And we're very excited not only for the Mac but also for the iPad. <Sync id="L217"time="00:33:00"/>We got a fantastic lineup of products, and we know that these products are incredibly relevant especially given the current circumstances. <Sync id="L218"time="00:33:11"/>So we expect the performance that we've seen for Mac in the June quarter to continue.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          <Sync id="L220"time="00:33:28"/>Tim, can you talk a bit about what you're seeing in China? <Sync id="L221"time="00:33:33"/>I know the revenue was up 2%, and I think Luca talked about record iPad. <Sync id="L222"time="00:33:37"/>But just curious as to -- given their 5G is a bit ahead, how you're seeing the market play out. <Sync id="L223"time="00:33:43"/>And then I have a follow-up.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Timothy D. Cook,  Apple Inc. - CEO & Director    [15]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          <Sync id="L224"time="00:33:45"/>Yes. <Sync id="L225"time="00:33:46"/>Shannon, the growth that -- we did see growth in Greater China for the quarter of 2%. <Sync id="L226"time="00:33:53"/>Currency affected China a bit more than in other places. <Sync id="L227"time="00:33:57"/>It affected 400 basis points, and so in constant currency, we would have grown at 6%. <Sync id="L228"time="00:34:04"/>As I'd mentioned before, the iPhone 11 has been our best-selling phone and has been #1 in Urban China, and so we're very, very proud of that. <Sync id="L229"time="00:34:16"/>iPad was helped in the June quarter there by the work-from-home and distance learning as it was in other geographies, and the Mac also grew strong double digit during the quarter. <Sync id="L230"time="00:34:35"/>And Services set a new June quarter record there. <Sync id="L231"time="00:34:40"/>We also continue to see extremely high new customer rates on Mac and iPad there. <Sync id="L232"time="00:34:47"/>To give you a perspective, about 3 out of 4 customers that are buying the Mac are new in China, and about 2 out of 3 that are buying the iPad are new. <Sync id="L233"time="00:34:58"/>And so these are numbers that we're super proud of.

Shannon Siemsen Cross,  Cross Research LLC - Co-Founder, Principal & Analyst    [16]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          <Sync id="L234"time="00:35:04"/>Great. <Sync id="L235"time="00:35:05"/>And then can you talk a little bit more about the decision to bring Mac silicon in-house and the benefits that you expect to see or you've seen from vertical integration of acquisitions like the Intel modem business?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Timothy D. Cook,  Apple Inc. - CEO & Director    [17]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          <Sync id="L236"time="00:35:20"/>Yes. <Sync id="L237"time="00:35:20"/>I mean what we wound up -- what we'll wind up with is a common architecture across all of our products, which gives us some interesting things that we can do in products that are -- that it sort of unleashes another round of innovation. <Sync id="L238"time="00:35:38"/>And so I don't want to say a lot about it other than we're extremely excited about it. <Sync id="L239"time="00:35:47"/>It's something that we've worked on quite a while to get to this point, and we're looking forward to shipping the first Mac with Apple silicon later in the year.

Amit Jawaharlaz Daryanani,  Evercore ISI Institutional Equities, Research Division - Senior MD & Fundamental Research Analyst    [19]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          <Sync id="L241"time="00:36:08"/>I have one and a follow-up as well. <Sync id="L242"time="00:36:13"/>So first one, I guess, Tim, if I think about the strength you're seeing with iPhones right now, do you have a sense in terms of where is this trend coming from? <Sync id="L243"time="00:36:20"/>Is it more replacement cycles getting shorter? <Sync id="L244"time="00:36:22"/>Or are we just getting new customers into the iOS ecosystem? <Sync id="L245"time="00:36:25"/>Because clearly, these growth rates seem fairly impressive in the context of a pandemic and the upcoming refresh cycle that we have.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Timothy D. Cook,  Apple Inc. - CEO & Director    [20]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          <Sync id="L246"time="00:36:34"/>I think, Amit, it's a combination of a strong launch with iPhone SE and in some -- probably some pickup because of the economic stimulus that hit different countries at different points in time and probably some of the reopening that took place across the quarter, particularly in May and June, as stores started to reopen. <Sync id="L247"time="00:37:01"/>And so it's a combination of all of those. <Sync id="L248"time="00:37:04"/>And as you know, we've been having a strong cycle with the iPhone 11 and the 11 Pro. <Sync id="L249"time="00:37:12"/>And so when you combine the -- a strong cycle plus an iPhone SE launch plus the reopening of the stores, et cetera, I think there were a lot of things that were going in the right direction there.

Amit Jawaharlaz Daryanani,  Evercore ISI Institutional Equities, Research Division - Senior MD & Fundamental Research Analyst    [21]

          <Sync id="L250"time="00:37:30"/>Perfect. <Sync id="L251"time="00:37:31"/>That's helpful. <Sync id="L252"time="00:37:32"/>And I guess, Luca, if I could just follow up with you. <Sync id="L253"time="00:37:33"/>I'd love to get your perspective on how do we think about the overall 38% gross margins. <Sync id="L254"time="00:37:39"/>What do you think are the levers to improve this as you go forward, not really September quarter but over the next 1 or 2 years? <Sync id="L255"time="00:37:46"/>And in that context, do you see a point where the product gross margins start to stabilize because they have been trending somewhat lower for the last couple of quarters now?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Luca Maestri,  Apple Inc. - CFO & Senior VP    [22]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          <Sync id="L256"time="00:37:56"/>Yes. <Sync id="L257"time="00:37:56"/>Let me start with what we've seen during the June quarter. <Sync id="L258"time="00:38:02"/>We were -- at 38%, we were down slightly sequentially but up the same amount on a year-over-year basis. <Sync id="L259"time="00:38:12"/>And really, the big negative impact that we felt for several quarters now has been the strength of the U.S. dollar. <Sync id="L260"time="00:38:21"/>So the foreign exchange impact on a sequential basis was 90 basis points, on a year-over-year basis was 130 basis points. <Sync id="L261"time="00:38:31"/>So obviously, that is something to keep in mind. <Sync id="L262"time="00:38:35"/>And then the other aspect, I think it's always important to keep in mind, Amit, is that we sell many different products. <Sync id="L263"time="00:38:44"/>They have different margin profiles. <Sync id="L264"time="00:38:45"/>And so sometimes, a different mix can have an impact on the aggregate level of products' gross margins. <Sync id="L265"time="00:38:54"/>And we're very pleased to see the performance of Mac, iPad and wearables, but obviously, it's a different mix. 
<Sync id="L266"time="00:39:04"/>Going forward, the variables are always the same. <Sync id="L267"time="00:39:10"/>It's -- the foreign exchange will continue to play an impact. <Sync id="L268"time="00:39:15"/>The mix of products that we're going to be selling will have an impact as well. <Sync id="L269"time="00:39:22"/>The commodities market has been relatively benign, and we'll see how that plays out over time. <Sync id="L270"time="00:39:31"/>As you know now for several years, we've been managing gross margin, I would say, fairly well in spite of some difficult situations like the one with the strength of the dollar, and we plan to continue to make good trade-off decisions between revenue and units and margins.

Kyle P. McNealy,  Jefferies LLC, Research Division - Equity Analyst    [24]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          <Sync id="L272"time="00:40:06"/>Our team in Asia, recently, we did some survey work on smartphones in China. <Sync id="L273"time="00:40:11"/>It showed that there's still a high proportion of the installed bases on 6, 7 and 8 devices. <Sync id="L274"time="00:40:17"/>I know you talked about the trade-in programs and promotions that you've been doing there. <Sync id="L275"time="00:40:21"/>I wonder if you can tell us whether there's anything else that you're doing to get these customers into your latest technology. <Sync id="L276"time="00:40:28"/>What might those customers be looking for? <Sync id="L277"time="00:40:29"/>And how should we think about when an upgrade cycle might come on more strongly there in China?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Timothy D. Cook,  Apple Inc. - CEO & Director    [25]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          <Sync id="L278"time="00:40:35"/>Customers upgrade at different -- at a different pace, and I don't have in front of me the exact installed base data from China. <Sync id="L279"time="00:40:47"/>But I mean much like in other geographies, the upgrades have extended some. <Sync id="L280"time="00:40:52"/>It extended some during the depths, if you will, of the pandemic in China and the rest of the world and probably, to some degree, is happening still at this point. <Sync id="L281"time="00:41:10"/>The key things that we can do is keep innovating, deliver a product that people can't imagine going through life without and obviously keep rolling out these programs that make the front-end purchase be much less. <Sync id="L282"time="00:41:30"/>And this is things like the financing and the trade-in programs that you mentioned. <Sync id="L283"time="00:41:35"/>And I do feel like those are going quite good in a number of geographies.

          <Sync id="L284"time="00:41:43"/>Okay. <Sync id="L285"time="00:41:43"/>Great. <Sync id="L286"time="00:41:43"/>And one more, if I may. <Sync id="L287"time="00:41:46"/>Congrats again on the strong iPad and Mac results. <Sync id="L288"time="00:41:48"/>That's really impressive. <Sync id="L289"time="00:41:50"/>I guess the obvious question is, should we ever think about how much of that might be pulled forward and what might it do to future upgrades in the next 2 years? <Sync id="L290"time="00:41:58"/>Anything else you can share on how you think about growth from here or whether there's a hangover period maybe after the back-to-school season or holiday season, that would be helpful.

Timothy D. Cook,  Apple Inc. - CEO & Director    [27]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          <Sync id="L291"time="00:42:10"/>The installed base is growing, and the new customer numbers that Luca went over in the aggregate are still very high in the -- close to 50% kind of range. <Sync id="L292"time="00:42:22"/>And so that, to me, makes the -- bodes well for the future. <Sync id="L293"time="00:42:28"/>There's clearly -- as we had indicated, there's some amount of work from home and remote learning that do affect the results of Mac and iPad positively. <Sync id="L294"time="00:42:42"/>They probably affect wearables and iPhone the other direction and -- but on Mac and iPad, these are productivity tools that people are using to stay engaged with their work or stay engaged with their school work. <Sync id="L295"time="00:42:59"/>And we believe we're going to have a strong back-to-school season. <Sync id="L296"time="00:43:05"/>Sitting here today, it certainly looks like that.

          <Sync id="L298"time="00:43:25"/>Tim, I was hoping you could share a little bit about where you think channel inventory is. <Sync id="L299"time="00:43:30"/>You talked about the tightness you saw exiting the June quarter for Mac and iPad. <Sync id="L300"time="00:43:36"/>Interested where you think inventory is across major product categories. <Sync id="L301"time="00:43:41"/>And then I had a follow-up for Luca.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Timothy D. Cook,  Apple Inc. - CEO & Director    [30]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          <Sync id="L302"time="00:43:44"/>We -- usually, we've gotten away from talking about channel inventories. <Sync id="L303"time="00:43:48"/>But to give you a perspective, sitting here, looking at it, on iPhone, the inventory is slightly less than it was a year ago. <Sync id="L304"time="00:43:56"/>And that's -- I'm saying that at a quarter end point, so at the end of Q3. <Sync id="L305"time="00:44:03"/>And obviously, iPad and Mac are constrained, and so both of those are less than they were in the year-ago quarter.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Benjamin James Bollin,  Cleveland Research Company - Senior Research Analyst    [31]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          <Sync id="L306"time="00:44:16"/>Okay. <Sync id="L307"time="00:44:16"/>And then, Luca, I'm interested. <Sync id="L308"time="00:44:18"/>Any color you could share about the impact COVID had on OpEx in the quarter, be it work-from-home stipends, less travel, other employee support costs? <Sync id="L309"time="00:44:29"/>And also, how the company is thinking about the longer-term opportunity of employees working remotely maybe more permanently and any considerations on how that could influence future OpEx.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Luca Maestri,  Apple Inc. - CFO & Senior VP    [32]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          <Sync id="L310"time="00:44:40"/>Well, on the OpEx front, there have been obviously certain things that have been affected in terms of cost reductions. <Sync id="L311"time="00:44:53"/>Obviously, travel is a perfect example. <Sync id="L312"time="00:44:58"/>The number of meetings that we had internally, some of those costs have been reduced. <Sync id="L313"time="00:45:04"/>We've also invested heavily in initiatives. <Sync id="L314"time="00:45:10"/>For example, we're really trying to help during very difficult circumstances. <Sync id="L315"time="00:45:16"/>For example, we have had a program, for example, where we match our employee donations. <Sync id="L316"time="00:45:22"/>We made donations directly as a company around the world to many institutions and governments. <Sync id="L317"time="00:45:29"/>On a net basis, I would say probably, the costs have outweighed the savings both during the March and the June quarter, but we think it's absolutely the right thing to do. 
<Sync id="L318"time="00:45:44"/>From an employee perspective, what we said so far is that here in the United States, most -- the majority of our population will continue to work from home until the end of the year. <Sync id="L319"time="00:46:01"/>And then we'll see. <Sync id="L320"time="00:46:01"/>I mean we've taken an approach that we try to understand how the virus is evolving over time. <Sync id="L321"time="00:46:10"/>We've taken a very cautious approach both with our corporate facilities and with our retail stores. <Sync id="L322"time="00:46:16"/>I think what you've seen with retail stores is that we have reopened in a number of geographies around the world. <Sync id="L323"time="00:46:25"/>We've reopened here in the United States. <Sync id="L324"time="00:46:27"/>We've had to reclose some of the stores here in the United States as the number of cases has gone up, and we will continue to track how the virus is doing. <Sync id="L325"time="00:46:38"/>And hopefully, at some point, we're going to get to a point where there is a vaccine or there is a cure. <Sync id="L326"time="00:46:46"/>And so we'll make those decisions as we get more information.

          <Sync id="L332"time="00:47:25"/>Well, as you've seen, obviously, we've had a sequential expansion in gross margin for Services, and that was driven primarily by mix, as you said, right? <Sync id="L333"time="00:47:38"/>We have a very broad portfolio. <Sync id="L334"time="00:47:40"/>And depending on which one of the services does better, then we have an impact on Services gross margins. <Sync id="L335"time="00:47:49"/>We like the Services business because it's a recurring type of revenue and the margins are accretive to company margin. <Sync id="L336"time="00:48:02"/>We did over 67% this quarter. <Sync id="L337"time="00:48:07"/>But we want to offer very competitive services across the board, and the same -- I think I'm going to make the same comments that I made on products. <Sync id="L338"time="00:48:20"/>What matters to us is to be successful with everything that we do and provide great products and services to our customers. <Sync id="L339"time="00:48:26"/>So the relative success of our products and services in the marketplace will drive, to a certain extent, what our margins are. <Sync id="L340"time="00:48:37"/>That's -- the margins are a by-product of our success in the marketplace.

Kanghui Ong,  Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division - Research Analyst    [36]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          <Sync id="L341"time="00:48:45"/>Got it. <Sync id="L342"time="00:48:45"/>I really appreciate that. <Sync id="L343"time="00:48:47"/>And I wanted to ask a question on the wearables segment. <Sync id="L344"time="00:48:51"/>It seems to me that you're categorizing the wearables business as maybe being a little bit impacted by pandemic similar to the iPhones. <Sync id="L345"time="00:49:01"/>And it's the first time that wearables hasn't materially upsided in at least a while in recent memory. <Sync id="L346"time="00:49:09"/>I guess the drivers of wearables being Watch and -- predominantly Watch and AirPods, what are your thoughts going forward on whether there's a little bit of pent-up demand perhaps that might resume as we get back to a more normalized environment?

Timothy D. Cook,  Apple Inc. - CEO & Director    [37]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          <Sync id="L347"time="00:49:23"/>I think on the Watch, in particular, is like the iPhone, more affected by store closures because people -- some people want to try on the Watch and see what it looks like, look at different band choices and those sorts of things. <Sync id="L348"time="00:49:45"/>So I think as stores closed, it puts more pressure on that. <Sync id="L349"time="00:49:51"/>I was -- we did come out sort of the way we told you last quarter. <Sync id="L350"time="00:49:57"/>We were going to come out from a -- from the color that we gave you. <Sync id="L351"time="00:50:01"/>So we knew things would decelerate because of the closures. <Sync id="L352"time="00:50:04"/>So we wound up being very pleased with how we did, but the store closures definitely affect the wearables and the iPhone.

Operator    [38]

          <Sync id="L353"time="00:50:20"/>That will come from Jim Suva with Citigroup.

Jim Suva,  Citigroup Inc., Research Division - MD & Research Analyst    [39]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          <Sync id="L354"time="00:50:31"/>And I have 2 questions. <Sync id="L355"time="00:50:32"/>I'll ask them at the same time, and it's one for Tim and one for Luca. <Sync id="L356"time="00:50:38"/>Tim, the coronavirus -- your company has done a fantastic job at overcoming the hurdle. <Sync id="L357"time="00:50:43"/>So congratulations to you. <Sync id="L358"time="00:50:44"/>As you look forward, say, to the Christmas holiday shopping season and given the economic challenges around the world of where is coronavirus and your product launches and things like that, can you give any commentary maybe how this Christmas, you're looking forward to see maybe some past cycles of Christmas of a line-up? <Sync id="L359"time="00:51:03"/>Because it just seems like it's a little bit different, but Apple is really showing a lot more strength coming into this Christmas than maybe some of the past years. 
<Sync id="L360"time="00:51:12"/>And then for Luca. <Sync id="L361"time="00:51:13"/>I think today, a quick comment, Luca, that -- you mentioned something about a few weeks later. <Sync id="L362"time="00:51:19"/>Was that for like iPhone, iPhone chips or product launches? <Sync id="L363"time="00:51:25"/>Or maybe expound upon that. <Sync id="L364"time="00:51:27"/>I know things are more difficult but I didn't quite get the commentary. <Sync id="L365"time="00:51:29"/>It was in your prepared comments, Luca, about a few weeks later. <Sync id="L366"time="00:51:34"/>Let's just do a quick little blurb.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Timothy D. Cook,  Apple Inc. - CEO & Director    [40]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          <Sync id="L367"time="00:51:38"/>Yes, we're -- we take it one quarter at a time, and so we'll give you a color on the December quarter in October. <Sync id="L368"time="00:51:49"/>Generally speaking, I think we need to see a vaccine or therapeutic or both, and there's some optimism around that in that particular time frame. <Sync id="L369"time="00:52:03"/>And so we'll see. <Sync id="L370"time="00:52:04"/>I don't have any information that isn't publicly available there, but I think that would boost consumer confidence quite a bit if it began to happen. <Sync id="L371"time="00:52:18"/>And I think that any kind of consumer stock company would benefit from that.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Luca Maestri,  Apple Inc. - CFO & Senior VP    [41]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          <Sync id="L372"time="00:52:24"/>And Jim, on the iPhone, I said in my remarks that we launched -- a year ago, we launched the new iPhone in late September. <Sync id="L373"time="00:52:35"/>So I was referring to the new product. <Sync id="L374"time="00:52:38"/>And I said that this year, the supply of the new product will be a few weeks later than that.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Jim Suva,  Citigroup Inc., Research Division - MD & Research Analyst    [42]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          <Sync id="L375"time="00:52:47"/>Congratulations to you and your entire organization and teams.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Operator    [43]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          <Sync id="L376"time="00:52:55"/>That will come from Wamsi Mohan with Bank of America.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Wamsi Mohan,  BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division - Director    [44]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          <Sync id="L377"time="00:53:04"/>I was wondering if you can maybe comment on the penetration of Apple Card users in the iOS installed base. <Sync id="L378"time="00:53:11"/>And have you seen any change in the buying behavior of Apple Card users in terms of accelerating spend on more Apple products and services? <Sync id="L379"time="00:53:19"/>And I have a follow-up.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Timothy D. Cook,  Apple Inc. - CEO & Director    [45]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          <Sync id="L380"time="00:53:21"/>We saw changes in consumer spending as the shutdowns occurred and as the store closures occurred. <Sync id="L381"time="00:53:31"/>We could see that across the Card. <Sync id="L382"time="00:53:35"/>It affected the categories that you would guess the most, like travel and entertainment, et cetera. <Sync id="L383"time="00:53:45"/>But overall, if you sort of pull the lens out on the Apple Card, we're very happy with the number of people that have the Apple Card. <Sync id="L384"time="00:53:57"/>We believe, based on what we've heard, that it's the fastest rollout in the history of credit cards, and so we feel very good about that.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Wamsi Mohan,  BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division - Director    [46]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          <Sync id="L385"time="00:54:09"/>Okay, Tim. <Sync id="L386"time="00:54:10"/>And as a follow-up, now that Apple has Apple silicon for Macs, would you ever consider monetizing this as a merchant silicon vendor? <Sync id="L387"time="00:54:20"/>Or is this going to be forever for Apple use?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Timothy D. Cook,  Apple Inc. - CEO & Director    [47]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          <Sync id="L388"time="00:54:26"/>Well, I don't want to make a forever comment but there are -- we're a product company and we love making the whole thing and -- because we can own the user experience in that way and with the goal of delighting the user. <Sync id="L389"time="00:54:42"/>And that's the reason that we're doing the Apple silicon is because we can envision some products that we can achieve with Apple silicon that we couldn't achieve otherwise. <Sync id="L390"time="00:54:54"/>And so that's how we look at it.
