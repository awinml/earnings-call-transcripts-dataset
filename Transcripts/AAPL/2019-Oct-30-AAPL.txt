          <Sync id="L200"time="00:31:11"/>Congratulations on the quarter. <Sync id="L201"time="00:31:13"/>iPhone revenue trajectory did improve, but it still declined 9%. <Sync id="L202"time="00:31:17"/>So can you talk about the drivers that will allow you to get that category back to growth and if you think that's something that's realistic to expect in fiscal '20?

Timothy D. Cook,  Apple Inc. - CEO & Director    [3]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          <Sync id="L203"time="00:31:29"/>Katy, it's Tim. <Sync id="L204"time="00:31:31"/>We're very thrilled with what we're seeing in the early going on iPhone 11 and iPhone 11 Pro and Pro Max. <Sync id="L205"time="00:31:42"/>It's early, but the trends look very good, so I don't want to make a long-range forecast here. <Sync id="L206"time="00:31:49"/>We've put our current thinking in the guidance, and you can tell that from the guidance, we are bullish.

          <Sync id="L207"time="00:32:01"/>Great. <Sync id="L208"time="00:32:01"/>And Luca, on margins, guidance is consistent with September, but there's a lot going on under the covers. <Sync id="L209"time="00:32:08"/>Tariffs could expand in mid-December. <Sync id="L210"time="00:32:10"/>There's some impact from the TV+ bundle. <Sync id="L211"time="00:32:14"/>You have some big currency and commodity price moves. <Sync id="L212"time="00:32:16"/>So can you just talk about the gives and takes that land you at the December quarter gross margin guidance?

Luca Maestri,  Apple Inc. - CFO & Senior VP    [5]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          <Sync id="L213"time="00:32:24"/>Yes. <Sync id="L214"time="00:32:24"/>Katy, of course. <Sync id="L215"time="00:32:26"/>As you said, I mean, at the midpoint of the range, we are essentially flat sequentially. <Sync id="L216"time="00:32:37"/>On one side, we expect -- on the positive side, we expect leverage from higher revenue. <Sync id="L217"time="00:32:47"/>On the other side, foreign exchange for us continues to be probably the biggest headwind that we got right now. <Sync id="L218"time="00:32:55"/>It's going to be negative 70 basis points on a sequential basis. <Sync id="L219"time="00:33:00"/>Also, keep in mind that during the holiday season, we have a higher mix of products revenue than we have in other quarters. <Sync id="L220"time="00:33:08"/>And that obviously is dilutive to the company margin. <Sync id="L221"time="00:33:16"/>On a year-over-year basis, we're also about flat. <Sync id="L222"time="00:33:23"/>And on one side, we've got better commodity pricing. <Sync id="L223"time="00:33:26"/>The environment is better than it was a year ago, but foreign exchange is a negative impact of 120 basis points on a year-over-year basis.

Michael Joseph Olson,  Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division - MD & Senior Research Analyst    [7]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          <Sync id="L225"time="00:33:53"/>So Wearables category has been strong, and it's hard to believe it's now essentially the same size as Mac. <Sync id="L226"time="00:33:59"/>But related to Apple's initiatives in health care, do you think health-related features are a primary driver of Wearables growth? <Sync id="L227"time="00:34:07"/>And maybe conversely, how important is the rising installed base of Wearables and the data that's associated with that to the ongoing innovation within Apple Health? <Sync id="L228"time="00:34:19"/>And then I have a follow-up.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Timothy D. Cook,  Apple Inc. - CEO & Director    [8]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          <Sync id="L229"time="00:34:19"/>Yes. <Sync id="L230"time="00:34:19"/>Michael, it's Tim. <Sync id="L231"time="00:34:21"/>The Wearables have done extremely well. <Sync id="L232"time="00:34:23"/>It was an acceleration further from the previous quarters, so we're thrilled with the results. <Sync id="L233"time="00:34:31"/>As to what's driving it, it's the totality that's driving it. <Sync id="L234"time="00:34:36"/>For some people, it's about fitness. <Sync id="L235"time="00:34:39"/>For some people, it's about health. <Sync id="L236"time="00:34:40"/>For some other people, it's about communication, and for some people, it's all of the above. <Sync id="L237"time="00:34:46"/>And I think the new feature of always-on on Series 5 is a game-changer for many of our users. 
<Sync id="L238"time="00:34:57"/>And in terms of other health-related things that we have going, we will be continuing to build out our health records connection into the Health app, really democratizes the information about people's health, and so they can easily go from doctor to doctor. <Sync id="L239"time="00:35:23"/>We've got the research going that I've mentioned earlier. <Sync id="L240"time="00:35:27"/>There will be more of those through time. <Sync id="L241"time="00:35:30"/>And obviously, we've got things that we're not going to talk about just yet that we're working on. <Sync id="L242"time="00:35:36"/>But as I've said before, my view is there will be a day in the future that we look back and Apple's greatest contribution will be to people's health.

Timothy D. Cook,  Apple Inc. - CEO & Director    [10]

          <Sync id="L245"time="00:36:07"/>Yes. <Sync id="L246"time="00:36:08"/>It's a gift to our users. <Sync id="L247"time="00:36:10"/>And from a business point of view, we'd like to -- we're really proud of the content. <Sync id="L248"time="00:36:16"/>We'd like as many people as possible to view it. <Sync id="L249"time="00:36:21"/>And so this allows us to focus on maximizing subscribers, particularly in the early going. <Sync id="L250"time="00:36:29"/>And so we're -- we feel great about doing that. <Sync id="L251"time="00:36:33"/>I think it's a bold move. <Sync id="L252"time="00:36:35"/>And the price also for those people that are not buying a device in the period of time that we offer this, the price is very aggressive as well. <Sync id="L253"time="00:36:46"/>You think about the quality of content that you get for $4.99, and it's amazing. <Sync id="L254"time="00:36:55"/>It is amazing.

Amit Jawaharlaz Daryanani,  Evercore ISI Institutional Equities, Research Division - Senior MD & Fundamental Research Analyst    [12]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          <Sync id="L256"time="00:37:07"/>I guess 2 questions from me as well. <Sync id="L257"time="00:37:08"/>First one, Tim, if you think about the Services business, you're less than $2 billion away from the targets you had laid out a few years back. <Sync id="L258"time="00:37:16"/>But I'm wondering if you think about the growth rates you've had in the business over the last several years, the high teens average, I think, how much of that do you think was driven by the installed base growing versus incremental monetization of the installed base? <Sync id="L259"time="00:37:28"/>And do you see that ratio essentially flipping or changing as you go forward?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Timothy D. Cook,  Apple Inc. - CEO & Director    [13]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          <Sync id="L260"time="00:37:32"/>I think we have opportunities, Amit, in both the growth of the installed base. <Sync id="L261"time="00:37:38"/>As Luca mentioned in his comments, we continue to grow across every category, hit new highs in the last quarter. <Sync id="L262"time="00:37:47"/>And we hit new highs in all of our top 20 markets. <Sync id="L263"time="00:37:52"/>And so the installed base is clearly a piece of it. <Sync id="L264"time="00:37:56"/>Getting the trade-in program going and the secondary market moving has been helpful in that as well. <Sync id="L265"time="00:38:07"/>And of course, the -- ultimately, the thing that builds the installed base is to make customers happy. <Sync id="L266"time="00:38:16"/>And that's our -- always our top objective is to have satisfied customers.
<Sync id="L267"time="00:38:21"/>The other thing that is obviously happening is in many areas, the ARPU is increasing. <Sync id="L268"time="00:38:30"/>And so as there's more offers out there, I mean, the one that is today getting the attention is on the streaming side. <Sync id="L269"time="00:38:39"/>But if you look at the number of services that have been added over the years, it's significant. <Sync id="L270"time="00:38:47"/>And people love them. <Sync id="L271"time="00:38:50"/>And so it's really both of those. <Sync id="L272"time="00:38:52"/>And obviously, finally, getting more people that are enjoying things for free to elect to pay for some of the premium services. <Sync id="L273"time="00:39:06"/>So it's sort of all 3 of those.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Amit Jawaharlaz Daryanani,  Evercore ISI Institutional Equities, Research Division - Senior MD & Fundamental Research Analyst    [14]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          <Sync id="L274"time="00:39:10"/>Got it. <Sync id="L275"time="00:39:10"/>And then if I could just kind of go back to the Wearables discussion, I mean, and especially if you think about Apple Watch and AirPods. <Sync id="L276"time="00:39:15"/>Is there a sense or a way to think about what's the attach rate today to iOS devices for Apple Watch or AirPods? <Sync id="L277"time="00:39:22"/>I guess I'm just trying to understand, if I think about 900 million-plus iPhone installed base, what kind of penetration do you have at Wearables and how long could this one may be as you go forward?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Timothy D. Cook,  Apple Inc. - CEO & Director    [15]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          <Sync id="L278"time="00:39:34"/>Well, we're not releasing the precise numbers of our Wearables, but it is a really nice try in getting me to say that. <Sync id="L279"time="00:39:42"/>The -- what we're seeing in terms of new ads on the watch, I think Luca may have mentioned this in his comments, is about 3/4 of the Apple Watch buyers are new to Apple Watch. <Sync id="L280"time="00:39:57"/>And so we are still and significantly in the build mode there. <Sync id="L281"time="00:40:04"/>And so don't think of the penetration as anywhere near a sort of a mature penetration. <Sync id="L282"time="00:40:13"/>We got a lot left there. 
<Sync id="L283"time="00:40:15"/>And the AirPods just keep hitting new highs. <Sync id="L284"time="00:40:21"/>And I anticipate that will carry over to this quarter too, and we're really proud to add another product up there for people wanting noise-canceling with the AirPods Pro beginning to sell today.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          <Sync id="L290"time="00:40:57"/>My questions though with regards to China. <Sync id="L291"time="00:41:01"/>And I don't know, Tim, if you can talk more about what you're seeing in China, the trends during the quarter, the reception specifically there to the iPhone. <Sync id="L292"time="00:41:10"/>Any thoughts on Hong Kong used to be a big market. <Sync id="L293"time="00:41:13"/>There's obviously some turmoil there. <Sync id="L294"time="00:41:14"/>So if can you just provide some more in China that will be helpful.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Timothy D. Cook,  Apple Inc. - CEO & Director    [20]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          <Sync id="L295"time="00:41:19"/>Yes. <Sync id="L296"time="00:41:19"/>We had a very good September, Shannon, and the lead of that is sort of the reception of iPhone 11 and 11 Pro and 11 Pro Max. <Sync id="L297"time="00:41:33"/>And so we feel really good about how we've gotten started there. <Sync id="L298"time="00:41:39"/>As you can tell from the numbers, we've significantly improved since the beginning of the year. <Sync id="L299"time="00:41:45"/>We've gone from minus well into the 20s to minus 2% last quarter. <Sync id="L300"time="00:41:53"/>And if you looked at that in constant currency, we actually grew 1%. <Sync id="L301"time="00:41:57"/>And so there's a very slight growth there. <Sync id="L302"time="00:42:00"/>We obviously want that to be better. <Sync id="L303"time="00:42:04"/>But we feel good about how we're doing. 
<Sync id="L304"time="00:42:06"/>I think it's a combination of things that are -- that have turned things around. <Sync id="L305"time="00:42:12"/>On a macro basis, I think the trade tension is less, and that clearly looks positive right now with the comments that we've been reading in the press. <Sync id="L306"time="00:42:26"/>Secondly, the products have been extremely well-received there. <Sync id="L307"time="00:42:33"/>Third, the things that we've done from a pricing and monthly payments point of view, and trade-in, getting the trade-in program up and running, all of these things have moved the dial. <Sync id="L308"time="00:42:46"/>And so it's sort of a -- the sum of all of that. 
<Sync id="L309"time="00:42:51"/>I would also say it's not all about iPhone in China. <Sync id="L310"time="00:42:54"/>The Services area grew double digit. <Sync id="L311"time="00:42:57"/>We began to see more gaming approvals in the quarter or I should say some key gaming approvals. <Sync id="L312"time="00:43:03"/>It's not all about quantity but about which ones. <Sync id="L313"time="00:43:08"/>We saw that. <Sync id="L314"time="00:43:11"/>Also, Wearables, where Wearables are doing so great at a company level, they're doing even better in China. <Sync id="L315"time="00:43:17"/>And so lots of positives there.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Shannon Siemsen Cross,  Cross Research LLC - Co-Founder, Principal & Analyst    [21]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          <Sync id="L316"time="00:43:24"/>And then I'm curious, Luca, maybe you can talk a bit about how you think about operating expense growth. <Sync id="L317"time="00:43:29"/>It continues to grow significantly faster than revenue. <Sync id="L318"time="00:43:33"/>So I'm just curious as to where you're targeting the incremental spend. <Sync id="L319"time="00:43:37"/>And then is there a point at which we might just see some leverage?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Luca Maestri,  Apple Inc. - CFO & Senior VP    [22]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          <Sync id="L320"time="00:43:44"/>Well, Shannon, we've gone through different cycles. <Sync id="L321"time="00:43:46"/>In some cases, our revenue growth exceeds our OpEx growth. <Sync id="L322"time="00:43:51"/>In other cases, like fiscal '19, it was the other way around. <Sync id="L323"time="00:43:55"/>But our approach frankly is not changing over time. <Sync id="L324"time="00:43:59"/>We want to invest in the business. <Sync id="L325"time="00:44:03"/>Our primary investments during the last few years have been in the R&D space because obviously we want to continue to innovate, improve the user experience, differentiate our products. 
<Sync id="L326"time="00:44:16"/>We continue to run SG&A tightly. <Sync id="L327"time="00:44:19"/>Obviously, if you look at what we've launched during the last few quarters and few years, we launched a lot of new products, and now we're launching a lot of new services. <Sync id="L328"time="00:44:30"/>And when we do that, we need to make the adequate investments in marketing and advertising to raise the awareness of the new products and new services. <Sync id="L329"time="00:44:41"/>And that is what you're seeing, for example, in the guidance that we provided for the first quarter as we're launching new services right now. <Sync id="L330"time="00:44:51"/>And so we're making investments both in engineering and in advertising to support the new launches.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Operator    [23]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          <Sync id="L331"time="00:45:01"/>That will come from Bernstein's Toni Sacconaghi.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
A.M. Sacconaghi,  Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division - Senior Analyst    [24]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          <Sync id="L332"time="00:45:08"/>I think this is for Luca, and then I have a follow-up as well. <Sync id="L333"time="00:45:12"/>If I look at your guidance, the midpoint of your guidance for revenues on a sequential basis, it's up about 36.5%. <Sync id="L334"time="00:45:22"/>Historically, fiscal Q4 to Q1 was up 50% or more. <Sync id="L335"time="00:45:27"/>And even last year, given that iPhone is a slower-growing product, you guided for revenues to be up 45% sequentially. <Sync id="L336"time="00:45:37"/>So given the enthusiasm about the iPhone 11 launch and the new Wearables products and the new Services, I guess the question is why is your guidance not stronger for Q1 on the top line? <Sync id="L337"time="00:45:59"/>And is that sort of a reflection of conservatism, given that there's a lot of uncertainty in the world and we certainly saw that last year? <Sync id="L338"time="00:46:08"/>Or are there other forces at work that we should be considering?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Luca Maestri,  Apple Inc. - CFO & Senior VP    [25]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          <Sync id="L339"time="00:46:15"/>Toni, thanks for the question. <Sync id="L340"time="00:46:18"/>The guidance that we are providing, if you look at it at the midpoint, implies an acceleration of growth from the performance that we've seen during the course of fiscal '19. <Sync id="L341"time="00:46:33"/>As I said earlier, foreign exchange is clearly a headwind for us right now. <Sync id="L342"time="00:46:39"/>There's about $1.1 billion of negative foreign exchange on a year-over-year basis. <Sync id="L343"time="00:46:46"/>So that is something to keep in mind. 
<Sync id="L344"time="00:46:51"/>We feel very good, as Tim said, about the iPhone, the way the new cycle has started. <Sync id="L345"time="00:46:57"/>And we do expect an improvement in our year-over-year growth rate on iPhone. <Sync id="L346"time="00:47:04"/>Wearables has very, very strong momentum. <Sync id="L347"time="00:47:06"/>The portfolio of Services also has incredible momentum. <Sync id="L348"time="00:47:13"/>One thing to keep in mind as we look at this guidance range is the fact that we also contemplated the comparison to the launch of the iPad Pro a year ago for iPad as well as the new MacBook Air that was launched during the December quarter last year. <Sync id="L349"time="00:47:34"/>So for the iPad and Mac categories, you need to keep in mind that our launch timing is different on a year-over-year basis.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
A.M. Sacconaghi,  Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division - Senior Analyst    [26]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          <Sync id="L350"time="00:47:45"/>Okay. <Sync id="L351"time="00:47:47"/>And then if I could follow up. <Sync id="L352"time="00:47:50"/>Just on the bundling of Apple TV+. <Sync id="L353"time="00:47:54"/>I guess for you, Tim, this is really the first time we've seen a significant bundling of services offering and a hardware offering. <Sync id="L354"time="00:48:06"/>And I'm wondering if you view this as kind of a strategic advantage of Apple and whether we might see more hardware plus services offerings -- bundled offerings. <Sync id="L355"time="00:48:17"/>And ultimately, to you, do you ever believe that your hardware itself might be offered as a bundled service? <Sync id="L356"time="00:48:27"/>And maybe while we're on that, either you or Luca could give us the 30-second tutorial on how we should think about the deferred revenue accounting, approximately how much of the $60 are you going to be deferring and what's your expectation for attach rate on that?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Luca Maestri,  Apple Inc. - CFO & Senior VP    [27]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          <Sync id="L357"time="00:48:45"/>Let me cover that accounting issue first. <Sync id="L358"time="00:48:49"/>Obviously, we need to make some assumptions around the take rate of our customers on the -- on Apple TV+, right? <Sync id="L359"time="00:48:59"/>And we don't want to get into the details of that because we view those assumptions as confidential and competitively sensitive. 
<Sync id="L360"time="00:49:07"/>But you need to keep in mind that we contemplate a number of factors, including the fact that we have family sharing as part of the service, the fact that there are multiple device purchases, the geographic availability around the world, the availability of local content at the beginning of the service, how many people do we have with payment methods on file. <Sync id="L361"time="00:49:31"/>So we use all these things to make assumptions around what the take rate is going to be. <Sync id="L362"time="00:49:39"/>Obviously, those assumptions will possibly change over time as we get more information on how the customers behave. <Sync id="L363"time="00:49:47"/>We haven't launched the service yet. <Sync id="L364"time="00:49:49"/>We're going to start serving our customers tomorrow, so we'll see how it goes, but we take into account all these different factors.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Timothy D. Cook,  Apple Inc. - CEO & Director    [28]

          <Sync id="L365"time="00:49:57"/>On the bundled question, Toni, we look at each service and decide what's best to do for it. <Sync id="L366"time="00:50:05"/>And on the TV+, we concluded that a great way to get more people to see the content would be to do this, and it would be a good gift for our users, and so that's what we're doing. <Sync id="L367"time="00:50:20"/>You can also see that on the other services, we're not doing that. <Sync id="L368"time="00:50:24"/>So it's not part of a broader pattern or -- although I wouldn't want to rule out for the future that we might not see another opportunity at some point in time.
<Sync id="L369"time="00:50:35"/>In terms of hardware as a service or as a bundle, if you will, there are customers today that essentially view the hardware like that because they're on upgrade plans and so forth. <Sync id="L370"time="00:50:54"/>And so to some degree, that exists today. <Sync id="L371"time="00:50:57"/>My perspective is that will grow in the future to larger numbers that will grow disproportionately. <Sync id="L372"time="00:51:08"/>And one of the things we're doing is trying to make it simpler and simpler for people to get on these sort of monthly financing kind of things that's a part of what we announced with the Apple Card earlier in the call. <Sync id="L373"time="00:51:23"/>And so we're cognizant that there are lots of users out there that want sort of a recurring payment like that and the receipt of new products on some sort of standard kind of basis. <Sync id="L374"time="00:51:41"/>And we're committed to make that easier to do than perhaps it is today.

Operator    [29]

          <Sync id="L375"time="00:51:48"/>That will be from Chris Caso with Raymond James.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Christopher Caso,  Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division - Research Analyst    [30]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          <Sync id="L376"time="00:51:52"/>And Nancy, our congratulations to you, too, and we're going to miss you.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Nancy Paxton,  Apple Inc. - Director-IR    [31]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          <Sync id="L377"time="00:52:00"/>Thank you.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Christopher Caso,  Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division - Research Analyst    [32]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          <Sync id="L378"time="00:52:03"/>My first question is about pricing and the effect of some of the lower price points for iPhone 11 as compared to last year. <Sync id="L379"time="00:52:12"/>And it looked like margins and the revenues did well on that. <Sync id="L380"time="00:52:18"/>And it also followed some price adjustments you made in emerging markets last year. <Sync id="L381"time="00:52:23"/>And obviously, we've seen some improvement in China as well. <Sync id="L382"time="00:52:25"/>So if you could talk about maybe what that tells us about pricing strategy in general and perhaps that you're willing to take a little more flexible approach to drive some elasticity if you think that's going to have a positive effect.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          <Sync id="L383"time="00:52:38"/>Yes. <Sync id="L384"time="00:52:40"/>Chris, I think that the price moves we've made have been smart and well-received and do show a level of elasticity. <Sync id="L385"time="00:52:51"/>But the most important thing by far is the product. <Sync id="L386"time="00:52:55"/>And I think we've got the best lineup we've ever had, and the customer response to the product, what the product does for them is really incredible. <Sync id="L387"time="00:53:05"/>And the photos I'm getting from many users around the world are just incredible that people are taking. <Sync id="L388"time="00:53:12"/>And so I think it's product first and then price sort of falls out of that. <Sync id="L389"time="00:53:18"/>And we did decide to be more aggressive. <Sync id="L390"time="00:53:24"/>And looking at the results in the early going, I think it was the right call. 
<Sync id="L391"time="00:53:30"/>In terms of emerging markets, we picked sort of locally relevant prices. <Sync id="L392"time="00:53:38"/>And in some cases where the dollar had become stronger, we took an exchange rate that would've reflected a while back instead of the current exchange rate. <Sync id="L393"time="00:53:53"/>And in other words, we tried to stay as close as we could to a local price point that we knew was effective for that particular market. <Sync id="L394"time="00:54:04"/>And those, in addition to the U.S. price that have gotten more of a discussion, have been extremely well-received.

Christopher Caso,  Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division - Research Analyst    [34]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          <Sync id="L395"time="00:54:19"/>As a follow-on, perhaps you could talk about the potential for some of the tariffs that are upcoming. <Sync id="L396"time="00:54:28"/>What -- do you have a view of what potential impact that could have going forward and how Apple is looking to address it? <Sync id="L397"time="00:54:37"/>Will you need to adjust your own pricing if, in fact, the tariffs are imposed?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Timothy D. Cook,  Apple Inc. - CEO & Director    [35]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          <Sync id="L398"time="00:54:45"/>We're paying some tariffs today, as you know, some that went into effect pre-September and some others that went into effect in September. <Sync id="L399"time="00:54:55"/>So we are paying some. <Sync id="L400"time="00:54:56"/>That's been comprehended. <Sync id="L401"time="00:54:59"/>But in general, my view is very positive in terms of how things are going. <Sync id="L402"time="00:55:05"/>And that positive view is obviously factored in our guidance as well, and just the tone, I think, has changed significantly. <Sync id="L403"time="00:55:18"/>And I have long thought that it was in both countries' best interest to get to an agreement that maybe initially doesn't solve everything but solves some things that each party may want and get to a better place than where we're at. <Sync id="L404"time="00:55:40"/>And I'm hopeful that that's where we're headed.

Operator    [36]

          <Sync id="L405"time="00:55:52"/>That will be from Samik Chatterjee with JPMorgan.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Samik Chatterjee,  JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division - Analyst    [37]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          <Sync id="L406"time="00:55:55"/>I just wanted to start off with one of -- new Services, Apple Arcade and if you have any insights in terms of what you're seeing for engagement or retention of customers beyond the initial trial period. <Sync id="L407"time="00:56:06"/>Also, how are your partnerships with developers progressing there? <Sync id="L408"time="00:56:10"/>How does the pipeline look like? <Sync id="L409"time="00:56:12"/>And any early projections of what that business longer term might look like?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Timothy D. Cook,  Apple Inc. - CEO & Director    [38]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          <Sync id="L410"time="00:56:18"/>We're not going to give out projections on it, but I would tell you that we were really pleased with the number of people that entered the trial period. <Sync id="L411"time="00:56:29"/>People are just coming out of the 30-day trial period in the last few days or a week or so, and so it's really too early to tell what the conversion rate will be. <Sync id="L412"time="00:56:46"/>But I feel like we're off to a good start, and the -- most important of everything, the customer feedback to date has really been incredible, and we're very excited for the future of the service.

Samik Chatterjee,  JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division - Analyst    [39]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          <Sync id="L413"time="00:57:01"/>Great. <Sync id="L414"time="00:57:01"/>Another follow-up, if I can try and attack the Wearables question with another angle. <Sync id="L415"time="00:57:06"/>What are you seeing in terms of typical -- consumer behavior in upgrading Wearables like Apple Watch or AirPods? <Sync id="L416"time="00:57:13"/>And how are you thinking about your ability to accelerate some of that replacement cycle by driving innovation?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Timothy D. Cook,  Apple Inc. - CEO & Director    [40]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          <Sync id="L417"time="00:57:21"/>I think we -- because the Watch is relatively young, we haven't seen enough upgrade cycles to really establish a pattern as yet. <Sync id="L418"time="00:57:34"/>And as I've mentioned before, 3 out of 4 customers buying an Apple Watch currently or last quarter, I should say, were buying an Apple Watch for the first time. <Sync id="L419"time="00:57:45"/>And so there's still a very, very large new to Apple Watch in this regard. <Sync id="L420"time="00:57:53"/>I do think the upgrade market will get larger over time but just don't have a current view as to how often and so forth.
<Sync id="L421"time="00:58:05"/>On the AirPods, we're anxious to see the customers for the new AirPods Pro. <Sync id="L422"time="00:58:16"/>But I would guess that one, particularly in the early going, will be people that have AirPods today and want to have a -- also have a pair for the times that they need noise cancellation.
