Operator    [1]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          <Sync id="L206"time="00:31:36"/>Certainly. <Sync id="L207"time="00:31:36"/>Our first question will come from Shannon Cross with Cross Research.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Shannon Siemsen Cross,  Cross Research LLC - Co-Founder, Principal & Analyst    [2]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          <Sync id="L208"time="00:31:41"/>Tim, can you talk a bit more about what you're seeing in China? <Sync id="L209"time="00:31:47"/>Clearly, it looks like things are improving sequentially. <Sync id="L210"time="00:31:51"/>You also mentioned that last few weeks of the quarter were stabilizing in emerging markets, I believe. <Sync id="L211"time="00:31:56"/>So what are customers saying there? <Sync id="L212"time="00:31:58"/>What are your partners saying in China? <Sync id="L213"time="00:32:00"/>And then I have a follow-up.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Timothy D. Cook,  Apple Inc. - CEO & Director    [3]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          <Sync id="L214"time="00:32:01"/>Yes. <Sync id="L215"time="00:32:01"/>Thanks for the question, Shannon. <Sync id="L216"time="00:32:05"/>We're seeing -- in the iPhone space, we saw a better year-over-year performance in the last weeks of the quarter as compared to the full quarter or November and December, which was sort of a -- appears to be the trough. <Sync id="L217"time="00:32:26"/>I think there's a set of reasons for this. <Sync id="L218"time="00:32:30"/>One, we made some price adjustments, essentially backing out the weaker currency effect and then some. <Sync id="L219"time="00:32:46"/>The -- there's stimulus programs that the government has executed, including, and this happened in early April, VAT being reduced from 16% to 13%, so they've been aggressive in the stimulus side. <Sync id="L220"time="00:33:05"/>Three, our trade-in and financing programs that we implemented in our retail stores have been very well received there, and I'm happy with the results to date there. <Sync id="L221"time="00:33:17"/>And then four, the -- there's an improved trade dialogue between the U.S. and China. <Sync id="L222"time="00:33:24"/>And from our point of view, this has affected consumer confidence on the ground there in a positive way. <Sync id="L223"time="00:33:32"/>And so I think it's a set of all of these things, and we certainly feel a lot better than we did 90 days ago.

Shannon Siemsen Cross,  Cross Research LLC - Co-Founder, Principal & Analyst    [4]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          <Sync id="L224"time="00:33:46"/>And then I'm sure you're probably expecting a question on Qualcomm settlement. <Sync id="L225"time="00:33:49"/>So what would you like to say on the settlement? <Sync id="L226"time="00:33:52"/>How are you thinking about your component providers going forward? <Sync id="L227"time="00:33:57"/>And how should we think about this with regard to, I don't know, your development plans in the future? <Sync id="L228"time="00:34:03"/>Because I'm sure you're not going to talk about when you're going to do 5G but clearly, it helps that path.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Timothy D. Cook,  Apple Inc. - CEO & Director    [5]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          <Sync id="L229"time="00:34:08"/>Yes. <Sync id="L230"time="00:34:08"/>Thank you, Shannon. <Sync id="L231"time="00:34:12"/>We're glad to put the litigation behind us, and all the litigation around the world have been dismissed and settled. <Sync id="L232"time="00:34:25"/>We're very happy to have a multi-year supply agreement. <Sync id="L233"time="00:34:29"/>And we're happy that we have a direct license arrangement with Qualcomm, which was, I know, important for both companies, and so we feel good about the resolution.

Operator    [6]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          <Sync id="L234"time="00:34:48"/>The next question will come from Samik Chatterjee with JPMorgan.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Samik Chatterjee,  JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division - Analyst    [7]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          <Sync id="L235"time="00:34:54"/>Tim, you talked about China responding well to the pricing actions that you've taken in that market. <Sync id="L236"time="00:35:00"/>Do any of those learnings kind of carry through into how you decide pricing in the remaining emerging markets like India, et cetera, as you get ready for the next product cycle?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Timothy D. Cook,  Apple Inc. - CEO & Director    [8]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          <Sync id="L237"time="00:35:11"/>We have made some adjustments in India, and we've seen preliminarily some better results there. <Sync id="L238"time="00:35:21"/>Everything that we do does advise everything we do in the future, so we try to learn the best we can and fold that into our thinking. <Sync id="L239"time="00:35:31"/>And we'll obviously do that with this as well.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Samik Chatterjee,  JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division - Analyst    [9]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          <Sync id="L240"time="00:35:36"/>I just had a quick follow-up for Luca on the Services side. <Sync id="L241"time="00:35:41"/>Luca, we see that you're guiding to higher operating expenses quarter-on-quarter. <Sync id="L242"time="00:35:46"/>How much of that incremental is going in to support the new services that you're planning to launch later in the year?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Luca Maestri,  Apple Inc. - CFO & Senior VP    [10]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          <Sync id="L243"time="00:35:53"/>Yes. <Sync id="L244"time="00:35:54"/>Of course, we are supporting both our products and Services business, and you can see the trajectory of our OpEx over the different quarters. <Sync id="L245"time="00:36:08"/>Clearly, as we add new services, we will need to make the necessary investments to support them. <Sync id="L246"time="00:36:16"/>Our Services business is -- has multiple streams. <Sync id="L247"time="00:36:22"/>In total, it is accretive to company gross margins. <Sync id="L248"time="00:36:27"/>You've seen the latest -- we're running services margins at over 60%. <Sync id="L249"time="00:36:33"/>So it's a very important business for us in many ways for our ecosystem and for our ability to monetize it. <Sync id="L250"time="00:36:42"/>And so clearly, we will make all the necessary investments to ensure that the new services are successful. <Sync id="L251"time="00:36:48"/>And we're really encouraged by the level of customer response that we received so far in anticipation for the launch of these services.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Operator    [11]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          <Sync id="L252"time="00:36:57"/>The next question will come from Katy Huberty with Morgan Stanley.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Kathryn Lynn Huberty,  Morgan Stanley, Research Division - MD and Research Analyst    [12]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          <Sync id="L253"time="00:37:07"/>Luca, if I look back over the past 5 years, June quarter revenue typically declines about 15% from the March quarter. <Sync id="L254"time="00:37:15"/>You're guiding to an 8% drop this year. <Sync id="L255"time="00:37:18"/>So can you just talk about which regions or product segments you think can outperform that typical seasonality?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Luca Maestri,  Apple Inc. - CFO & Senior VP    [13]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          <Sync id="L256"time="00:37:27"/>Yes, Katy. <Sync id="L257"time="00:37:28"/>And keep in mind, by the way, we are reporting this guidance including a 300 basis point negative impact from foreign exchange, so actually, in constant currency, the numbers would be even stronger. <Sync id="L258"time="00:37:44"/>At the product category level, we expect that we continue to have strong revenue growth from the non-iPhone categories as we've had for the first half of our fiscal year. <Sync id="L259"time="00:37:59"/>We're also expecting a relative improvement in our iPhone performance on a year-over-year basis in Q3 versus the first half. <Sync id="L260"time="00:38:06"/>As Tim said, March was the strongest month of the quarter on a year-over-year basis, and so this has given the confidence to provide the guidance that you've seen. <Sync id="L261"time="00:38:20"/>Geographically, of course, as you've seen from our results for the March quarter, China is the geo where we found some challenges, but we believe the trajectory should improve over time.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Kathryn Lynn Huberty,  Morgan Stanley, Research Division - MD and Research Analyst    [14]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          <Sync id="L262"time="00:38:39"/>And then just as a follow-up, Shannon said you're not going to talk specifics around the timing of the 5G phone, but Tim, maybe you can talk about how the company approaches a new technology like this given the higher cost but also potentially significant benefit, how you think about the right timing for coming to market with a product with those characteristics and then just, generally, how meaningful, you think, 5G is as a demand driver for upgrades in your iPhone installed base.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Timothy D. Cook,  Apple Inc. - CEO & Director    [15]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          <Sync id="L263"time="00:39:14"/>Katy, this is one that I'm going to largely punt on as you would probably guess. <Sync id="L264"time="00:39:22"/>We look at a lot of things on the different technologies and try to look at the -- and select the right time that things come together and get those into products as soon as we can. <Sync id="L265"time="00:39:40"/>And the -- certainly, from a cost point of view, there has been -- the technologies have had cost pressure over the last couple of years or so. <Sync id="L266"time="00:39:53"/>On the flip side of that, there's a number of things in the commodity markets going in the other direction at the moment like DRAM and NAND. <Sync id="L267"time="00:40:04"/>And so it's difficult to project what happens next, but it's the aggregate of all of it that really matters from a price point of view.

Operator    [16]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          <Sync id="L268"time="00:40:20"/>Jim Suva from Citi has our next question.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Jim Suva,  Citigroup Inc, Research Division - Director    [17]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          <Sync id="L269"time="00:40:25"/>A topic that's probably split or shared by both Tim and Luca on a response but I'll ask the question and you can decide how to divide it up. <Sync id="L270"time="00:40:34"/>In your opening remarks, Tim, you'd mentioned about pricing adjustments that you made in some of the markets, and then Luca talked also about the strength of the trade-in program or maybe it was Tim also. <Sync id="L271"time="00:40:46"/>Can you help us understand about what type of lessons or elasticity you've learned about pricing and the trade-in programs of how it impacts like revenues and COGS and margins and things?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Timothy D. Cook,  Apple Inc. - CEO & Director    [18]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          <Sync id="L272"time="00:41:00"/>Yes. <Sync id="L273"time="00:41:01"/>Jim, the -- in the opening remarks, I was really talking about China specifically. <Sync id="L274"time="00:41:06"/>And I mentioned 4 things that I believe are responsible for the better year-over-year performance in the Q2 relative to Q1 and also the final weeks of March being better than the Q2 average. <Sync id="L275"time="00:41:27"/>And those 4 are the price reductions but that's 1 of them. <Sync id="L276"time="00:41:35"/>But there are 3 others, and 1 of the others is the trade-in and financing programs that we instituted in our retail stores. <Sync id="L277"time="00:41:44"/>Clearly, what we've learned here and it's not a surprise really is that the -- many, many people do want to trade in their current phone. <Sync id="L278"time="00:41:55"/>It does -- from a customer user point of view, the trade-in looks like a subsidy, and so it is a way to offset the device cost itself. <Sync id="L279"time="00:42:08"/>And many people in literally every market that we've tried this in, there is a reasonable number of people that want to take and pay for something on installments instead of all at once. <Sync id="L280"time="00:42:25"/>And so it's a little different in each market in terms of what the elasticity is, but you can bet that we're learning quickly on all of those.
<Sync id="L281"time="00:42:35"/>The other 2 items that are not insignificant in China that I don't want to lose here is that the stimulus programs, I believe, are having an effect on the consumer. <Sync id="L282"time="00:42:50"/>And the 1 that I got much visibility in -- that happened in early April was the VAT reduction from 16% to 13%, so it's a very aggressive move. <Sync id="L283"time="00:43:02"/>But there are other stimulus programs as well that likely have an effect to the consumer level. <Sync id="L284"time="00:43:09"/>And then finally, and this is not to be underweighted either, I think the improved trade dialogue between the countries affects consumer confidence in a positive way. <Sync id="L285"time="00:43:21"/>And so I think it's sort of the sum of all of those things.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Luca Maestri,  Apple Inc. - CFO & Senior VP    [19]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          <Sync id="L286"time="00:43:25"/>And Jim, if I may add on the gross margin level, as we look at pricing actions, of course, anytime you do a pricing action, it is gross margin percentage diluted. <Sync id="L287"time="00:43:36"/>But what really matters to us and what we look at when we look at the elasticity of these programs is to see the impact on our gross margin dollars. <Sync id="L288"time="00:43:44"/>And what -- the experience that we've had in a few of these emerging markets has been positive in that respect, and so that's what we think matters the most really.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Operator    [20]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          <Sync id="L289"time="00:44:02"/>The next question will come from Wamsi Mohan with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Wamsi Mohan,  BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division - Director    [21]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          <Sync id="L290"time="00:44:08"/>Tim, you shared a lot of color around trade-ins, but I was also hoping maybe you can characterize what sort of dynamics you're seeing across your installed base on these trade-ins. <Sync id="L291"time="00:44:20"/>What type of devices are being traded in? <Sync id="L292"time="00:44:23"/>Is the profile of someone who has a really old iPhone? <Sync id="L293"time="00:44:28"/>Or are you seeing folks that have newer iPhones trading in? <Sync id="L294"time="00:44:32"/>And what sort of incentives are you providing beyond sort of the financing to drive that? <Sync id="L295"time="00:44:39"/>And do you see this as something that can accelerate replacement cycles here over the next year or so? <Sync id="L296"time="00:44:45"/>And I have a follow-up.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Timothy D. Cook,  Apple Inc. - CEO & Director    [22]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          <Sync id="L297"time="00:44:48"/>We're -- actually, the product that's being traded in is all over the place, to be honest. <Sync id="L298"time="00:44:53"/>It's 6, 6 Plus, 6s, 6s Plus, 7, 7 Plus and then fewer 8 and 8 Plus. <Sync id="L299"time="00:45:04"/>But there's some of each of those, and so you get customers that are on the 2-year cycle and customers -- some customers on the 1-year cycle and then customers as well on the 3- and 4-year cycles. <Sync id="L300"time="00:45:21"/>And so it's really all over the place. <Sync id="L301"time="00:45:23"/>In terms of the incentives, we're offering currently in our retail stores a trade-in value that has -- that is more than the sort of the blue book of the device, if you will, for lack of a better description. <Sync id="L302"time="00:45:44"/>And so we have topped those up to provide an extra benefit to the user.
<Sync id="L303"time="00:45:52"/>The installments are different in each geography. <Sync id="L304"time="00:45:52"/>I would say that, at the moment, the geography that is doing the best in installments would be China. <Sync id="L305"time="00:46:07"/>And we have a bit of a unique offering there, I think, versus the -- versus what you can get in the regular market, and so that probably further helps there. <Sync id="L306"time="00:46:23"/>And so you can bet that we're learning on each of these, finding the parts that the user likes the most.
<Sync id="L307"time="00:46:31"/>I think the key is we're trying to build a -- build something into the consumer mindset that it's good for the environment and good for them to trade in their current device on a new device. <Sync id="L308"time="00:46:48"/>And we do our best of getting the current device to someone else that can use that or, in some cases, if the product is at an end of life, we are recycling the parts on it to make sure that it can carry on in another form.

Wamsi Mohan,  BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division - Director    [23]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          <Sync id="L309"time="00:47:13"/>And as my follow-up, Luca, can you just clarify if the settlement with Qualcomm is creating either a headwind or a tailwind to your gross margins in the near term? <Sync id="L310"time="00:47:23"/>And does your guidance contemplate incremental pricing actions that could be creating some gross margin headwinds?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Luca Maestri,  Apple Inc. - CFO & Senior VP    [24]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          <Sync id="L311"time="00:47:31"/>As Tim has explained, we've reach this comprehensive agreement with Qualcomm. <Sync id="L312"time="00:47:36"/>As part of this, we have agreed that we're not going to share the financial terms of the agreement, so we plan to honor that. <Sync id="L313"time="00:47:46"/>What you see in our gross margin guidance for the June quarter, we guided 37% to 38%, fully comprehends the outcome of the agreement with Qualcomm.

          <Sync id="L315"time="00:48:09"/>So you have more than 1.4 billion active devices, and at your event, you announced services that leverage that installed base. <Sync id="L316"time="00:48:16"/>And you have obviously a remarkable position with kind of this Trojan horse of devices out in so many households. <Sync id="L317"time="00:48:22"/>So I guess the question is -- and I know some of these services aren't even live yet, but should we expect a continuation of the building out of new services categories like what we saw at the March event? <Sync id="L318"time="00:48:31"/>Is there a pipeline of new services in the works? <Sync id="L319"time="00:48:34"/>Or have we kind of seen what we're likely to see on that front for the near to intermediate term? <Sync id="L320"time="00:48:39"/>And then I have a follow-up.

          <Sync id="L321"time="00:48:40"/>Yes, I wouldn't want to get into announcing things on the call, but obviously, we're always working on new things. <Sync id="L322"time="00:48:47"/>And -- but we're -- right now, we're really focused on getting these 4 out there. <Sync id="L323"time="00:48:53"/>We have the News+ in the market today. <Sync id="L324"time="00:48:57"/>We'll have the Apple Arcade and the Apple TV+ products in the market in the fall, and Apple Card will go out in the summer timeframe. <Sync id="L325"time="00:49:08"/>And so we've got lots in front of us, and we're very excited about getting these out there.

          <Sync id="L326"time="00:49:18"/>Right. <Sync id="L327"time="00:49:19"/>And then you mentioned the App Store search ad business a couple of times in the prepared remarks. <Sync id="L328"time="00:49:24"/>Is that reaching a point where it's become material and maybe moving the needle for overall Services revenue? <Sync id="L329"time="00:49:30"/>Or is there anything you can quantify related to that? <Sync id="L330"time="00:49:33"/>I also imagine that this is a high-margin business, at least maybe higher than the overall Services margin but wondering if you can confirm if that's the case or not.

          <Sync id="L331"time="00:49:42"/>It's growing very, very fast, Mike. <Sync id="L332"time="00:49:45"/>I think it was up around 70% over the previous year. <Sync id="L333"time="00:49:50"/>We're expanding into new geographies as well, and we still have more geographies out there that we think can move the dial further. <Sync id="L334"time="00:50:00"/>So it is a -- it's definitely a business that is big and getting bigger.

          <Sync id="L336"time="00:50:22"/>Tim, when you look at the 4 things that you have announced, and I realize they have different dates when they're coming out, but which ones would you say, over the next 12 months, has the most potential to help your Services line? <Sync id="L337"time="00:50:33"/>And then maybe which one has the best long-term potential? <Sync id="L338"time="00:50:38"/>And then I have a quick follow-up.

Timothy D. Cook,  Apple Inc. - CEO & Director    [32]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          <Sync id="L339"time="00:50:40"/>We're going to wait until we get these things out. <Sync id="L340"time="00:50:42"/>And what I can tell you right now is that the -- we're taking sort of consumer interest on the Apple Card, and there's been a significant level of interest on that and we're excited. <Sync id="L341"time="00:50:56"/>As you know, the -- gaming is the top category on the App Store. <Sync id="L342"time="00:51:01"/>And so the Apple Arcade will serve some of that market, and it serves it with a different kind of game, which we think will be great for developers and great for users.
<Sync id="L343"time="00:51:17"/>The TV+ product plays in a market where it's -- there's a huge move from the cable bundle to over the top. <Sync id="L344"time="00:51:29"/>We think that most users are going to get multiple over-the-top products, and we're going to do our best to convince them that the Apple TV+ product should be one of them. <Sync id="L345"time="00:51:44"/>And then we're working very hard to get everyone to give Apple News+ a look because we think it's a very unique product. <Sync id="L346"time="00:51:56"/>And I love magazines, and we have really wanted to support the publishers. <Sync id="L347"time="00:52:06"/>And so we're working very hard to -- at the -- but at the very beginning of the ramp there. <Sync id="L348"time="00:52:13"/>We wouldn't do a service that we didn't think could be meaningful, so that's sort of the way I look at it. <Sync id="L349"time="00:52:24"/>Yes, these aren't hobbies.

          <Sync id="L350"time="00:52:26"/>Okay. <Sync id="L351"time="00:52:27"/>A quick follow-up on India. <Sync id="L352"time="00:52:29"/>Obviously, market share there is well, well below China. <Sync id="L353"time="00:52:32"/>I believe you're looking to start manufacturing there. <Sync id="L354"time="00:52:34"/>But what's the -- obviously, the potential could be huge, but the market already seems to be pretty dominated on the Android side. <Sync id="L355"time="00:52:42"/>So maybe if you could just talk about trying to really aggressively ramp up share there.

          <Sync id="L356"time="00:52:50"/>I think India is a very important market in the long term. <Sync id="L357"time="00:52:56"/>It's a challenging market in the short term, but we're learning a lot. <Sync id="L358"time="00:53:03"/>We have started manufacturing there, which is very important to be able to serve the market in a reasonable way, and we're growing that capability there. <Sync id="L359"time="00:53:15"/>And we would like to place retail stores there, and we're working with the government to seek approval to do that. <Sync id="L360"time="00:53:28"/>And so we plan on going in there with sort of all of our might. <Sync id="L361"time="00:53:33"/>We've opened a developer accelerator there, which we're very happy with some of the things coming out of there. <Sync id="L362"time="00:53:41"/>It's a long-term play. <Sync id="L363"time="00:53:43"/>It's not something that's going to be on overnight huge business, but I think the growth potential is phenomenal. <Sync id="L364"time="00:53:55"/>It doesn't bother me that it's primarily Android business at the moment because that just means there's a lot of opportunity there.
