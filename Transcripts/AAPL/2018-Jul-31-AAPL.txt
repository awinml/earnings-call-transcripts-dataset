Kathryn Lynn Huberty,  Morgan Stanley, Research Division - MD and Research Analyst    [2]

          <Sync id="L181"time="00:29:22"/>I'll ask both my questions upfront. <Sync id="L182"time="00:29:24"/>First, for Tim, you're on track to hit your Services revenue target even earlier than planned. <Sync id="L183"time="00:29:31"/>So how are you thinking about the next legs of Services growth as you move into the next 3 to 5 years? <Sync id="L184"time="00:29:40"/>And then for you Luca, NAND prices are falling this year. <Sync id="L185"time="00:29:44"/>Services mix is rising. <Sync id="L186"time="00:29:46"/>Those should both positively influence gross margins. <Sync id="L187"time="00:29:49"/>And yet, we're seeing gross margin sort of hang out here at 38%. <Sync id="L188"time="00:29:54"/>What are the offsetting headwinds? <Sync id="L189"time="00:29:57"/>And is it possible that we could see the tailwinds start to overpower those headwinds in the next couple of quarters and see gross margins drift higher?

          <Sync id="L190"time="00:30:10"/>Yes, Katy, thanks for your questions, it's Tim. <Sync id="L191"time="00:30:13"/>On the Services side, we're thrilled with the results. <Sync id="L192"time="00:30:18"/>They were very broad-based. <Sync id="L193"time="00:30:21"/>We had double-digit Services growth in all of the geographic segments. <Sync id="L194"time="00:30:27"/>And the App Store, AppleCare, Apple Music, cloud services, Apple Pay all set new June quarter records. <Sync id="L195"time="00:30:36"/>And then, of course, subscriptions have now passed 300 million as I've mentioned before. <Sync id="L196"time="00:30:42"/>And so we're -- we couldn't be happier with how things are going. <Sync id="L197"time="00:30:47"/>In terms of the next leg of this, we're -- given the momentum that we're seeing across the board, we feel great about our current services. <Sync id="L198"time="00:31:02"/>But obviously, we're also thrilled about our pipeline that have some new services in it as well. <Sync id="L199"time="00:31:10"/>And so with the combination of these, we feel great about hitting our objectives and maybe even doing a little better.

          <Sync id="L200"time="00:31:21"/>Katy, for margins, let me tell you about the puts and takes for the June quarter, then I'll talk about the guidance for Q4 and make some general observations for the future. <Sync id="L201"time="00:31:37"/>Starting with the June quarter, typically, we see a decline in gross margin going from the March quarter to the June quarter. <Sync id="L202"time="00:31:46"/>Last year, we were down 40 bps, 2 years ago, we were down 140 bps. <Sync id="L203"time="00:31:51"/>This year, we were able to keep GM flat sequentially. <Sync id="L204"time="00:31:58"/>During the quarter, we always have some loss of leverage because of our typical seasonality. <Sync id="L205"time="00:32:03"/>This year, we were able to offset that with some cost improvements, and also we had some favorability in foreign exchange on a sequential basis. <Sync id="L206"time="00:32:12"/>Unfortunately, as you know, the U.S. dollar has already appreciated again recently, so we do not expect to see that favorability to repeat during the September quarter. <Sync id="L207"time="00:32:25"/>But those are the puts and takes for June, and we're very happy to see gross margin sequentially flat for June. <Sync id="L208"time="00:32:37"/>For September, we're also guiding about flat sequentially at the midpoint. <Sync id="L209"time="00:32:43"/>As you know, we typically have what we call product transition costs during the September quarter. <Sync id="L210"time="00:32:50"/>And this year, we also have about 30 bps of headwind from foreign exchange, again because the dollar has appreciated recently. <Sync id="L211"time="00:32:59"/>We expect those 2 factors to be offset by positive leverage because we've seen the revenue guidance that we provided and the mix to Services that you've actually mentioned during your question. <Sync id="L212"time="00:33:14"/>So we feel pretty good about most of the guidance for the fourth quarter. <Sync id="L213"time="00:33:20"/>Looking forward, you know we don't provide guidance beyond the current quarter, but I think we have a pretty good record over the last several years to make good business decisions, balancing units, revenue and margins. <Sync id="L214"time="00:33:37"/>As you know, foreign exchange has been a very significant headwind over the last 3-plus years, but we've been able to manage that. <Sync id="L215"time="00:33:51"/>On the memory front, it is true that prices have started to decline. <Sync id="L216"time="00:33:57"/>It has been a significant headwind for the last 12 to 18 months and still in the June quarter was negative. <Sync id="L217"time="00:34:07"/>We believe that we're going to start seeing some improvement from here on.

          <Sync id="L219"time="00:34:30"/>Tim, can you talk a bit about trends within your iPhone sales? <Sync id="L220"time="00:34:33"/>ASPs were above expectations. <Sync id="L221"time="00:34:37"/>And now that you've had -- and that was clearly better than some of the comments from some of your competitors. <Sync id="L222"time="00:34:42"/>Now that you've had about 9 months of experience with the high-end fully featured phone, can you talk a bit about what you think customers want, what the elasticity of demand is and how you're sort of thinking about your competitive position? <Sync id="L223"time="00:34:55"/>And then I have a follow-up.

Timothy D. Cook,  Apple Inc. - CEO & Director    [7]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          <Sync id="L224"time="00:34:58"/>Yes. <Sync id="L225"time="00:34:58"/>Shannon, we feel great about the results on iPhone, up 20%. <Sync id="L226"time="00:35:03"/>And if you look for the cycle -- by the cycle, I mean Q1, Q2 and Q3, we've had, on an average weekly basis, growth in units of sort of mid-single-digit and ASP growth of double-digit. <Sync id="L227"time="00:35:21"/>And so if you -- and look at iPhone X in particular, it's the most innovative smartphone on the market. <Sync id="L228"time="00:35:31"/>We priced it at a level that represented the value of it, and we're really -- we could not be happier that it has been the top-selling iPhone since the launch, and so we feel terrific about iPhone X. If you look at the -- sort of the top of our line together, and by that I mean the iPhone X, the 8 and the 8 Plus, they are growing very nicely as you can probably tell from looking at the ASP, and we couldn't be happier with how that's gone. <Sync id="L229"time="00:36:16"/>And so I think in this cycle, we've learned that customers want innovative products. <Sync id="L230"time="00:36:25"/>And we sort of already knew that in other cycles and other points in times, but it just puts an exclamation point by that, I believe, with looking at the results. <Sync id="L231"time="00:36:36"/>On the -- at the unit level, the iPhone SE had a difficult comp to the year-ago quarter, and so -- when we changed some of the configurations -- the memory configurations in the year-ago quarter. <Sync id="L232"time="00:36:50"/>If you look at it on a geographic basis, the top 3 selling phones in urban China were iPhone, where iPhone X was #1 and has been for a couple of quarters. <Sync id="L233"time="00:37:05"/>And iPhones make up 3 of the top 5 smartphones in the U.S., U.K. and Japan. <Sync id="L234"time="00:37:14"/>And so it's difficult sometimes to get a read over exactly what's happening in the market. <Sync id="L235"time="00:37:24"/>But given the industry numbers that we've seen, it's clear that we picked up global market share and picked up market share in several countries, not only iPhone but iPad as well.

          <Sync id="L236"time="00:37:44"/>Great. <Sync id="L237"time="00:37:44"/>And then can you talk a bit about China, up 19% -- Greater China, up 19% year-over-year during the quarter, I believe? <Sync id="L238"time="00:37:52"/>Obviously, iPhone doing well, but -- there was some concern that maybe some of what's going on in the trade world might have impacted, it doesn't seem like that. <Sync id="L239"time="00:38:00"/>So I'm just curious as to what you're seeing in China and how you're thinking about it as you look forward.

Timothy D. Cook,  Apple Inc. - CEO & Director    [9]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          <Sync id="L240"time="00:38:05"/>Yes, it's a good question. <Sync id="L241"time="00:38:07"/>Thank you. <Sync id="L242"time="00:38:08"/>This is the fourth consecutive quarter that we've had double-digit growth in Greater China. <Sync id="L243"time="00:38:16"/>I mentioned how iPhone X and sort of the iPhones were selling. <Sync id="L244"time="00:38:21"/>We did pick up share in iPhone and iPad. <Sync id="L245"time="00:38:24"/>But if you look more holistically at our complete line, we had a double-digit growth from Services to iPad to iPhone and to our other product category, which the Watch did extremely well. <Sync id="L246"time="00:38:38"/>And so there are lots of good things happening there. <Sync id="L247"time="00:38:43"/>In terms of the tariffs themselves, maybe I could sort of take a step back because I'm sure that a lot -- some people have questions on this. <Sync id="L248"time="00:38:52"/>And our view on tariffs is that they show up as a tax on the consumer and wind up resulting in lower economic growth and -- sometimes can bring about significant risk of unintended consequences. <Sync id="L249"time="00:39:17"/>That said, the trade relationships and agreements that the U.S. has between -- between the U.S. and other major economies are very complex, and it's clear that several are in need of modernizing. <Sync id="L250"time="00:39:32"/>But we think that in the vast majority of situations that tariffs are not the approach to doing that, and so we're sort of encouraging dialogue and so forth. <Sync id="L251"time="00:39:46"/>In terms of the tariffs that have been imposed or have exited the comment period, I think that there's one that's exiting today, there have been 3 of those. <Sync id="L252"time="00:39:59"/>And maybe I could walk through those briefly just to make sure everybody's on the same page. <Sync id="L253"time="00:40:03"/>The first was the U.S. imposed a tariff on steel and aluminum that was -- many, many different countries, that started, I believe, at the beginning of June. <Sync id="L254"time="00:40:15"/>There have been 2 other tariffs that have totaled about $50 billion of goods from China that have either been implemented or are exiting the comment period in this month. <Sync id="L255"time="00:40:29"/>I think the latest one is today. <Sync id="L256"time="00:40:33"/>If you look at those 3 tariffs, none of our products were directly affected by the tariffs. <Sync id="L257"time="00:40:42"/>There is a fourth tariff, which includes goods valued at $200 billion, also focused on goods that are imported from China. <Sync id="L258"time="00:40:54"/>That one is out for public comment. <Sync id="L259"time="00:40:56"/>Probably like everyone else, we're evaluating that one, and we'll be sharing our views of it with the administration and so forth before the comment period for that one ends. <Sync id="L260"time="00:41:09"/>It's actually a tedious process in going through it because you not only have to analyze the revenue products, which are a bit more straightforward to analyze, but you also have to analyze the purchases that you're making through other companies that are not related to revenue. <Sync id="L261"time="00:41:28"/>Maybe they're related to data centers and this sort of thing. <Sync id="L262"time="00:41:32"/>And so we're going through that now, and we'll be sharing our results later on those and feeding back from the comment. <Sync id="L263"time="00:41:46"/>Of course, the risk associated with more of a macroeconomic issue, such as an economic slowdown in one or more countries or currency fluctuations that are related to tariffs is very difficult to quantify. <Sync id="L264"time="00:42:00"/>And so that -- and we're not even trying to quantify that, to be clear about it. <Sync id="L265"time="00:42:07"/>All of this said, we're optimistic, as I've been the whole time, that this will get sorted out because there's an inescapable mutuality with -- between the U.S. and China that sort of serves as a magnet to bring both countries together. <Sync id="L266"time="00:42:25"/>Each country can only prosper if the other does. <Sync id="L267"time="00:42:28"/>And of course, the world needs both U.S. and China to prosper, for the world to do well. <Sync id="L268"time="00:42:38"/>That said, I can't predict the future, but I am optimistic that the countries will get through this. <Sync id="L269"time="00:42:49"/>And we are hoping that calm heads prevail.

          <Sync id="L274"time="00:43:38"/>Yes, sure, Brian. <Sync id="L275"time="00:43:38"/>Thanks for the question. <Sync id="L276"time="00:43:41"/>We're very excited to work with Oprah. <Sync id="L277"time="00:43:43"/>We think that her incomparable ability and talent to connect with audiences around the world are -- there's no match. <Sync id="L278"time="00:43:53"/>And we think that we can do some great original content together, and so we could not be happier in working with Oprah. <Sync id="L279"time="00:44:05"/>As you know, we hired 2 highly respected television executives last year, and they have been here now for several months and have been working on a project that we're not really ready to share the -- all the details about it yet. <Sync id="L280"time="00:44:27"/>But I couldn't be more excited about what's going on there. <Sync id="L281"time="00:44:33"/>And we've got great talent in the area that we've sourced from different places and feel really good about -- felt really good about what we will eventually offer. <Sync id="L282"time="00:44:49"/>In terms of the sort of the key catalysts and the changes -- the cord-cutting, in our view, is only going to accelerate and probably accelerate at a much faster rate than is widely thought. <Sync id="L283"time="00:45:07"/>We're seeing the things that we have on the periphery of this like Apple TV units and revenue grew by very strong double digits, very, very strong double digits in Q3. <Sync id="L284"time="00:45:23"/>As I mentioned in my opening comments, we're seeing different providers pick up the Apple TV and use it as their box to go to market with their subscription service. <Sync id="L285"time="00:45:40"/>There are -- within the 300 million-plus paid subscriptions, some of these are third-party video subscriptions, and we see the growth that is going on there. <Sync id="L286"time="00:45:53"/>It's like 100% year-over-year. <Sync id="L287"time="00:45:57"/>And so all the things from a -- all the forcing functions here from the outside all point to dramatic changes speeding up in the content industry. <Sync id="L288"time="00:46:15"/>And so we're really happy to be working on something but just not ready to talk about it in, in depth today. <Sync id="L289"time="00:46:25"/>In terms of Apple Music, we're well over 50 million listeners now when you add the -- our paid subscribers and the folks in the trial. <Sync id="L290"time="00:46:41"/>And so we're moving along at a very, very good rate. <Sync id="L291"time="00:46:47"/>It appears to us and what we've been told is that we took the leadership position in North America during the quarter, and we had leadership position in Japan. <Sync id="L292"time="00:47:05"/>And so in some of the markets that we've been in for a long period of time, we're doing quite well. <Sync id="L293"time="00:47:17"/>But really, the key thing in Music is not the competition between companies that are providing music, it's the -- the real challenge is to grow the market because if you add everyone up that's providing subscription music today or streaming music, it's -- outside of China, it's less than 200 million probably around the world. <Sync id="L294"time="00:47:45"/>And so it does seem to me, there's an extraordinary opportunity in that business to grow the market well. <Sync id="L295"time="00:47:54"/>And I think if we put our emphasis there, which we're doing, that -- we'll be a beneficiary of that as other people will as well. <Sync id="L296"time="00:48:07"/>But I like where we are. <Sync id="L297"time="00:48:10"/>Our revenues on Apple Music grew over 50%, as I'd mentioned earlier, during the quarter. <Sync id="L298"time="00:48:17"/>And so it's really, really strong, strong results. <Sync id="L299"time="00:48:26"/>Thanks for the question.

          <Sync id="L300"time="00:48:27"/>Toni Sacconaghi with Bernstein has our next question.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
A.M. Sacconaghi,  Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division - Senior Analyst    [14]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          <Sync id="L301"time="00:48:36"/>I have one for Luca and one for Tim, please. <Sync id="L302"time="00:48:41"/>Luca, I'm wondering, as we think about modeling Q4, iPhone ASPs are typically up sequentially about 2% to 4%, sort of low single digits. <Sync id="L303"time="00:48:55"/>Perhaps you can help us think through how we should be thinking about Q4. <Sync id="L304"time="00:48:59"/>I know you provided some commentary last quarter on how we should be thinking about Q3 ASPs.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Luca Maestri,  Apple Inc. - CFO & Senior VP    [15]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          <Sync id="L305"time="00:49:03"/>Toni, as you know, we do not provide guidance for either units or ASPs for any product category. <Sync id="L306"time="00:49:16"/>But of course, we provide a guidance on revenue. <Sync id="L307"time="00:49:18"/>And the guidance range implies growth of 16% to 19%. <Sync id="L308"time="00:49:25"/>We expect the growth to come from strong growth from iPhone, from Services and from Wearables, which has been a bit of our pattern during the course of the year. <Sync id="L309"time="00:49:38"/>On iPhone ASP, the only thing that I would point out is that, obviously, we're exiting the June quarter at a significantly higher level than in the past. <Sync id="L310"time="00:49:49"/>And so that, I think it's important to keep in mind -- as we move into the September quarter, it's important to keep in mind the type of revenue growth that we've implied in our guidance.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          <Sync id="L311"time="00:50:04"/>Okay. <Sync id="L312"time="00:50:05"/>Tim, I was wondering if you could just comment a little bit about the health of the smartphone market. <Sync id="L313"time="00:50:12"/>Apple's smartphone iPhone units have been relatively flat for 4 years. <Sync id="L314"time="00:50:19"/>And I think you've probably been a share gainer during the period, which would suggest, at least at the high end of the market, that is perhaps flat to down. <Sync id="L315"time="00:50:28"/>And I'm wondering if you can comment on, a, whether you believe that and what you think might be happening with replacement cycles and specifically also what impact, if any, you've seen from wider availability and less expensive replacement batteries for iPhones.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Timothy D. Cook,  Apple Inc. - CEO & Director    [17]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          <Sync id="L316"time="00:50:52"/>I think the smartphone market is very healthy. <Sync id="L317"time="00:50:56"/>I think it's actually the best market in the world to be in for someone that is in the business that we're in. <Sync id="L318"time="00:51:05"/>So it's an enormous-sized market and whether it grows -- from our point of view, whether it grows 1% or 2% or 5% or 6% or 10% or shrinks 1% or 2%, it's a great market because it's just huge. <Sync id="L319"time="00:51:26"/>And so that's kind of the way that I view that. <Sync id="L320"time="00:51:30"/>iPhone revenues are up 20% for the quarter over last year. <Sync id="L321"time="00:51:38"/>We're really pleased with that. <Sync id="L322"time="00:51:39"/>And if you look at the sort of this cycle, which I'll define as Q1, Q2, Q3 for ease, you'll see that we've grown like mid-single digits and -- on an average weekly sales point of view and, of course, double-digit on ASP. <Sync id="L323"time="00:52:02"/>And so I think it's really healthy. <Sync id="L324"time="00:52:06"/>In terms of replacement cycles, as I've mentioned I think on a previous call, some replacement cycles are lengthening. <Sync id="L325"time="00:52:16"/>I think that the major catalyst for that was probably the subsidy plans becoming a much smaller percentage of total sales around the world than they were at one time. <Sync id="L326"time="00:52:36"/>And so I think that some are lengthening and -- but I think for us, the thing that we always have to do is come out with a really great innovative product. <Sync id="L327"time="00:52:47"/>And I think that iPhone X shows that when you deliver great innovative product, there's enough people there that would like that, and it can be a really good business. <Sync id="L328"time="00:52:59"/>And so that's how I look at that. <Sync id="L329"time="00:53:02"/>In terms of the -- our installed base, which is something very important for us as it is one of the key drivers of Services, our active installed base on iPhone grew double digits over last year during the quarter. <Sync id="L330"time="00:53:22"/>And so we're thrilled with that. <Sync id="L331"time="00:53:24"/>And you can see that carrying through to the Services line, in the -- and the growth that we have there. <Sync id="L332"time="00:53:31"/>In terms of batteries, we have never done an analysis internally about how many people decided to get a lower-priced battery than buy another phone because it was never about that for us. <Sync id="L333"time="00:53:46"/>It was always about doing something great for the user. <Sync id="L334"time="00:53:51"/>And I think if you treat the users and customers well, then you have a good business over time, and so that's how we look at that.

          <Sync id="L339"time="00:54:16"/>Great, okay. <Sync id="L340"time="00:54:17"/>Super. <Sync id="L341"time="00:54:17"/>I'd like to focus on product road map and strategy. <Sync id="L342"time="00:54:20"/>There is a war going on for the home, the connected home, over the Internet of Things. <Sync id="L343"time="00:54:25"/>And with 2 products, the HomePod and Apple TV in the home, my question is, strategically, how do you feel about the importance of being in the home and whether it threatens your dominance outside the home, with your core business in the mobile devices, if you sort of lose that battle? <Sync id="L344"time="00:54:43"/>I'm just trying to figure out strategically, when you think about where the puck's going, how important is it for you to have a beachhead in the home as well as out of home?

          <Sync id="L345"time="00:54:52"/>I think the home business, Laura, is bigger than the HomePod and Apple TV. <Sync id="L346"time="00:54:59"/>They're both important products clearly. <Sync id="L347"time="00:55:03"/>But everybody has their iPhone at home as well and everybody has their Mac at home and everyone has their iPad at home. <Sync id="L348"time="00:55:10"/>And so in terms of the -- Siri access points, there -- as you can tell from the 100 billion number I quoted in the script, there's an extraordinary amount of usage of these products that are used to perform home-related functions. <Sync id="L349"time="00:55:31"/>I do that every day with controlling all my home automation and so on and so forth. <Sync id="L350"time="00:55:36"/>Part of that is on HomePod, but part of it is with the Apple Watch and the iPhone and the iPad. <Sync id="L351"time="00:55:45"/>And so I think home is important. <Sync id="L352"time="00:55:47"/>Home is important. <Sync id="L353"time="00:55:48"/>Work is important. <Sync id="L354"time="00:55:49"/>The movement between the 2 are important. <Sync id="L355"time="00:55:54"/>Health is important. <Sync id="L356"time="00:55:56"/>So the smartphone has become the repository that goes across the whole of your life, not something that is just meant for a portion of it. <Sync id="L357"time="00:56:08"/>And so I think all of those are important, and we're focused on all of them. <Sync id="L358"time="00:56:13"/>Thanks for your question.

          <Sync id="L359"time="00:56:17"/>That's helpful actually. <Sync id="L360"time="00:56:19"/>Yes, sort of. <Sync id="L361"time="00:56:20"/>I mean, I'll watch your product road map and be able to tell what the answer is. <Sync id="L362"time="00:56:24"/>The other thing, the thing I get in fights with investors about the most is this, and I'd love your insight on this. <Sync id="L363"time="00:56:30"/>I love the expansion of the new products. <Sync id="L364"time="00:56:32"/>The question I have is, are they actually on-ramped into the Apple ecosystem, the Beats, the Watch, the AirPods, subscriptions? <Sync id="L365"time="00:56:42"/>Are they on-ramped into the ecosystem? <Sync id="L366"time="00:56:45"/>Or is the on-ramp to the ecosystem the iPhone, and then these new products add revenue per member once you get somebody into the ecosystem via the iPhone?

          <Sync id="L367"time="00:56:59"/>The -- a lot of people that buy Apple products buy for the whole ecosystem even though they might not currently use all the different products. <Sync id="L368"time="00:57:15"/>And so the way that I think about those products are they're products within the ecosystem itself. <Sync id="L369"time="00:57:22"/>And there's a -- the AirPods have really gone through the roof, and the Apple Watch has hit an air pocket and has gone to a whole different level, as I had mentioned earlier, with our overall Wearables revenue. <Sync id="L370"time="00:57:41"/>And so in my view, this is a part of the -- they are a core part of the ecosystem.

          <Sync id="L371"time="00:57:47"/>And so they attract a new person to the ecosystem. <Sync id="L372"time="00:57:52"/>Or does the person have to have an iPhone first?

Timothy D. Cook,  Apple Inc. - CEO & Director    [27]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          <Sync id="L373"time="00:57:55"/>It is -- well, but on your point though, it is clear from communications that I've had with users that some of them were attracted to iPhone because of the Apple Watch. <Sync id="L374"time="00:58:09"/>And so the Apple Watch led them to the iPhone. <Sync id="L375"time="00:58:12"/>The reverse of that is also true is that somebody got the iPhone and then decided, "I really want something to coach me in fitness and to curate some of the communications and so forth like the Watch does so well." And so it's not always a linear path. <Sync id="L376"time="00:58:35"/>I see these things as being somewhat fluid and different for each user.

          <Sync id="L377"time="00:58:41"/>So they're complementary and self-reinforcing. <Sync id="L378"time="00:58:45"/>Okay, that makes sense. <Sync id="L379"time="00:58:46"/>All right.

          <Sync id="L380"time="00:58:47"/>Exactly right. <Sync id="L381"time="00:58:48"/>Thank you for the questions.
