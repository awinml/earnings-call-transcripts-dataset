Operator    [1]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          <Sync id="L168"time="00:25:48"/>(Operator Instructions) First, we'll hear from Katy Huberty with Morgan Stanley.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Kathryn Lynn Huberty,  Morgan Stanley, Research Division - MD and Research Analyst    [2]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          <Sync id="L169"time="00:25:54"/>My first question is for Luca around gross margin. <Sync id="L170"time="00:25:57"/>How were you able to expand gross margin sequentially and guide rather seasonally for the June quarter in light of what's going on in the memory market? <Sync id="L171"time="00:26:08"/>And maybe if you can comment, in particular, whether the holdback of payments to Qualcomm is benefiting you at all on gross margins year-on-year, and also whether your contracts around commodity prices is likely to hit gross margins by more in the back half of this calendar year.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Luca Maestri,  Apple Inc. - CFO and SVP    [3]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          <Sync id="L172"time="00:26:30"/>Thank you, Katy, a lot of questions. <Sync id="L173"time="00:26:32"/>Let me take one by one. <Sync id="L174"time="00:26:34"/>Let me start with our performance for the March quarter, which we were very happy with. <Sync id="L175"time="00:26:40"/>As you said, we were up 40 basis points sequentially, and this is in spite of the fact, as you know, that we lose leverage as we go from the December quarter to the March quarter. <Sync id="L176"time="00:26:50"/>The foreign exchange headwind on a sequential basis was 100 basis points. <Sync id="L177"time="00:26:55"/>Obviously, that was also a negative. <Sync id="L178"time="00:26:57"/>And as you said, we started to experience some level of cost pressure on the memory side, particularly on NAND and DRAM. <Sync id="L179"time="00:27:08"/>To offset that and actually do better than that, we had very good cost performance on other commodities. <Sync id="L180"time="00:27:16"/>And the fact that our Services mix increases as we go through the year, that is, of course, also helping given the profile of our gross margin for Services. <Sync id="L181"time="00:27:28"/>So that answers the question around Q2.
<Sync id="L182"time="00:27:32"/>As we move into the June quarter, as you know, we tend to have some level of gross margin compression as we go from the March quarter to the June quarter. <Sync id="L183"time="00:27:46"/>Again, the majority of that comes from the sequential loss of leverage. <Sync id="L184"time="00:27:52"/>We also have a different mix of products as we move into the June quarter. <Sync id="L185"time="00:27:59"/>And the cost pressures on memory will remain. <Sync id="L186"time="00:28:06"/>We expect to offset partially these impacts with other cost efficiencies and again, with a mix shift towards Services. <Sync id="L187"time="00:28:20"/>Yet, the impact on NAND and DRAM will continue to be there, and we expect it to be there. <Sync id="L188"time="00:28:25"/>You know we don't guide past the June quarter, but we expect it to be there for the time being.
<Sync id="L189"time="00:28:32"/>On Qualcomm, I just want to make it very, very clear that we are accruing. <Sync id="L190"time="00:28:42"/>We do not expect to be paying more than what we are accruing right now. <Sync id="L191"time="00:28:46"/>So we didn't get any benefit in our P&L, in our margins during the March quarter, and we're not getting any benefit during the June quarter either.

          <Sync id="L192"time="00:29:03"/>And just a follow-up for Tim. <Sync id="L193"time="00:29:05"/>As you noted in your remarks, the iPhone 7 Plus demand it's selling incredibly well, and this is a product that was pretty severely supply constrained in the December quarter. <Sync id="L194"time="00:29:18"/>And I just wonder whether there are any lessons learned as you go forward into future product launches around how you manage the timing of announcing a product when there's supply constraints and how you might work with the supply chain differently around ramping some of these components that have particular difficulties around the yields early on.

          <Sync id="L195"time="00:29:44"/>Yes. <Sync id="L196"time="00:29:44"/>Katy, one of the things that we did not get right was the mix between the iPhone 7 and the iPhone 7 Plus. <Sync id="L197"time="00:29:55"/>There was -- wound up the demand was much stronger to the 7 Plus than we had predicted. <Sync id="L198"time="00:30:03"/>And so it took us a little while to adjust all the way back through the supply chain and to bring iPhone 7 Plus into balance, which occurred in this early -- this past quarter. <Sync id="L199"time="00:30:19"/>What did we learn from it? <Sync id="L200"time="00:30:21"/>Every time we go through a launch, we learn something. <Sync id="L201"time="00:30:25"/>And you can bet that we're brushing up our models, and we'll apply everything we learned to the next time.

Timothy D. Cook,  Apple Inc. - CEO and Director    [8]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          <Sync id="L208"time="00:31:07"/>Yes. <Sync id="L209"time="00:31:07"/>Thanks for the question, Shannon. <Sync id="L210"time="00:31:09"/>We saw in Q2 the -- a performance that, combined with Q1 and that formed the first half of the year, was much better than what we experienced in the second half of last year. <Sync id="L211"time="00:31:24"/>And if you look at what was driving that, iPhone 7 Plus, we sold the highest number of Plus models in the first half than ever before compared to 6s Plus or compared to the 6 Plus. <Sync id="L212"time="00:31:44"/>We -- also the Mac business did extremely well. <Sync id="L213"time="00:31:48"/>The Mac revenue growth was up 20% in China, and we had extremely strong Services growth during the quarter in China. <Sync id="L214"time="00:32:00"/>As I've mentioned in the -- in my comments, our retail and online stores did well overall, and in China they grew by 21%, which is an acceleration from what we had seen in the previous quarter.
<Sync id="L215"time="00:32:19"/>And traffic, which, for us, is incredibly important in the retail stores because we do a lot more than sell, traffic was up 27% year-on-year. <Sync id="L216"time="00:32:33"/>And now 7 of our top 10 highest traffic stores in the world are in Greater China. <Sync id="L217"time="00:32:41"/>And so that's the set of things that sort of went in our direction, so to speak.
<Sync id="L218"time="00:32:48"/>On the flip side, currency devalued by 5%, and so that's not an insignificant headwind. <Sync id="L219"time="00:33:00"/>And our performance continued to be weak in Hong Kong, which has been hit a bit harder as the tourism market continues to slump. <Sync id="L220"time="00:33:15"/>Also where the iPhone 7 Plus did well, we didn't perform as well on some of the previous generation iPhones. <Sync id="L221"time="00:33:24"/>And so that's sort of the set of things on the plus and minus side. <Sync id="L222"time="00:33:32"/>We did perform about where I thought we would. <Sync id="L223"time="00:33:35"/>In fact, I thought it would be similar to the previous quarter and it was. <Sync id="L224"time="00:33:38"/>What I now believe is that we'll improve a bit more during this current quarter, not back to growth but improve -- but make more progress. <Sync id="L225"time="00:33:52"/>And we continue to believe that there's an enormous opportunity there. <Sync id="L226"time="00:34:00"/>And in the scheme of things, our business is pretty large there.

          <Sync id="L242"time="00:36:04"/>I wanted to start off just going back to the 165 million subscriptions and ask Tim or Luca if you could comment on the unique number of users there. <Sync id="L243"time="00:36:14"/>And I think you had made a comment, Tim, in your prepared remarks that the average revenue per user is up, or maybe that was you, Luca. <Sync id="L244"time="00:36:20"/>But if you guys could just talk about any more color around that average revenue per user, it would be interesting to us. <Sync id="L245"time="00:36:27"/>And then I have one follow-up to that.

Luca Maestri,  Apple Inc. - CFO and SVP    [13]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          <Sync id="L246"time="00:36:30"/>Yes. <Sync id="L247"time="00:36:31"/>I'll take it, Rod. <Sync id="L248"time="00:36:32"/>We don't disclose into this number of subscriptions. <Sync id="L249"time="00:36:36"/>Of course, we're just giving you the total count of subscriptions that are out there. <Sync id="L250"time="00:36:40"/>Of course, there are several customers that subscribe to more than one of our services. <Sync id="L251"time="00:36:47"/>There is some level of overlap, but the total number of subscribers is very, very large, obviously less than 165 million. <Sync id="L252"time="00:36:58"/>But it's very good for us to see the breadth of subscriptions that we offer and that customers are interested in. <Sync id="L253"time="00:37:07"/>It's a large number.
<Sync id="L254"time="00:37:08"/>And if you remember, we quoted the same number a quarter ago, and we talked about 150 million. <Sync id="L255"time="00:37:14"/>So when you think about a sequential increase of 15 million subscriptions from the December quarter to the March quarter, it really gives you a sense for the momentum that we have on our content stores, right? <Sync id="L256"time="00:37:27"/>It's quite impressive to add 15 million subscriptions in 90 days. <Sync id="L257"time="00:37:33"/>On -- as we look at the dynamics that are happening on our content stores and particularly on the App Store, which is the largest, we see fairly consistently 2 things. <Sync id="L258"time="00:37:46"/>We see that the number of paying accounts is growing a lot. <Sync id="L259"time="00:37:51"/>And I mentioned the increase in number of paying accounts that we've had during these last 90 days is the largest that we've ever had. <Sync id="L260"time="00:38:00"/>So there's a very large number of people coming into the ecosystem, experiencing the ecosystem, which is obviously improving all the time in quality and quantity, and then start paying and transacting on the -- on our stores. <Sync id="L261"time="00:38:15"/>And that number is growing very, very strongly, strong double digits.
<Sync id="L262"time="00:38:19"/>What we're also seeing, as we look at the people that start paying on our stores, we see a pretty common trend over time, and we keep track of that across cohorts of customers, that as people come into the ecosystem and start paying on the ecosystem, we see a spending profile that is very similar around the world. <Sync id="L263"time="00:38:44"/>People start at a certain level, and then they tend to spend more over time. <Sync id="L264"time="00:38:49"/>And so obviously, the combination of people spending more over time and adding more people that are now actually spending on the stores contributes to this 40% growth that Tim mentioned for the App Store on a year-over-year basis.

          <Sync id="L269"time="00:39:41"/>Rod, the way that we think about pricing is we come up with a price that we think is a good value for the product that we're delivering, and we do that on the hardware side as well as on the Services side. <Sync id="L270"time="00:40:03"/>And so that's how we think about it. <Sync id="L271"time="00:40:06"/>We're really not thinking about taking profits from one to subsidize the other or vice versa.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Timothy D. Cook,  Apple Inc. - CEO and Director    [18]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          <Sync id="L278"time="00:40:51"/>Thanks for the question. <Sync id="L279"time="00:40:53"/>We have seen the Watch as a really key product category for us since before we launched it. <Sync id="L280"time="00:41:01"/>And we took our time to get it right, and we've made it even better with the Series 2 offering. <Sync id="L281"time="00:41:12"/>And we're really proud of the growth of the business. <Sync id="L282"time="00:41:18"/>The Watch units more than doubled in 6 of our top 10 markets, which is phenomenal growth, particularly in a non-holiday quarter. <Sync id="L283"time="00:41:30"/>And so we couldn't be more satisfied with it. <Sync id="L284"time="00:41:34"/>When -- as some people are doing, when you begin to combine that -- combine the Watch revenues with the revenues for AirPods, this was the first -- as you know, this is the first full quarter of shipments for AirPods, but it's still very much in the ramping mode. <Sync id="L285"time="00:41:55"/>And we're not coming close to satisfying the demand.
<Sync id="L286"time="00:41:58"/>And then add the Beats products that our -- a group of our customers really enjoy as well and look on the trailing 12 months. <Sync id="L287"time="00:42:09"/>So this is not a forecast. <Sync id="L288"time="00:42:11"/>That business was well into the Fortune 500. <Sync id="L289"time="00:42:18"/>And so as I look at that, that's pretty fast to come that far. <Sync id="L290"time="00:42:24"/>The Watch hasn't been out very long, and AirPods have been out there for 3, 4 months. <Sync id="L291"time="00:42:31"/>And so we feel really great about it.
<Sync id="L292"time="00:42:34"/>Where does it go? <Sync id="L293"time="00:42:35"/>I wouldn't want to comment on that, but we do have a really great pipeline here. <Sync id="L294"time="00:42:47"/>And I think in terms of competition falling out and so forth, it's -- the watch area is really hard. <Sync id="L295"time="00:42:58"/>It, in essence, from an engineering point of view, is similar to a phone in terms of the intricacies and so forth. <Sync id="L296"time="00:43:11"/>And so it's not -- I'm not very surprised that some people are falling out of it. <Sync id="L297"time="00:43:17"/>But we're very committed to it and believe that -- it's already a big business and believe over time it will be even larger.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          <Sync id="L312"time="00:45:48"/>The -- anyone that has a standards-essential patent has a responsibility to offer it to everyone that would like it under what is -- are called FRAND terms. <Sync id="L313"time="00:46:06"/>FRAND stands for fair, reasonable and nondiscriminatory terms. <Sync id="L314"time="00:46:13"/>That's both the price and the business terms. <Sync id="L315"time="00:46:17"/>Qualcomm has not made such an offer to Apple, and so I don't believe that a -- I don't believe anyone's going to decide to enjoin the iPhone based on that. <Sync id="L316"time="00:46:32"/>I think that there's plenty of case law around that subject. <Sync id="L317"time="00:46:38"/>But we shall see.
<Sync id="L318"time="00:46:41"/>In terms of why we're withholding royalties, you can't pay something when there's a dispute about the amount. <Sync id="L319"time="00:46:52"/>You don't know how much to pay. <Sync id="L320"time="00:46:54"/>And so they think we owe some amount. <Sync id="L321"time="00:47:00"/>We think we owe a different amount. <Sync id="L322"time="00:47:02"/>And there hasn't been a meeting of the minds there, and so at this point, we need the courts to decide that unless we are able to, over time, settle between us on some amount. <Sync id="L323"time="00:47:19"/>But right now we're depending upon the courts to do that, and so that is the thinking.
<Sync id="L324"time="00:47:26"/>The reason that we're pursuing this is that Qualcomm's trying to charge Apple a percentage of the total iPhone value, and they do some really great work around standards-essential patents, but it's one small part of what an iPhone is. <Sync id="L325"time="00:47:49"/>It's not -- it has nothing to do with the display or the Touch ID or a gazillion other innovations that Apple has done. <Sync id="L326"time="00:47:59"/>And so we don't think that's right. <Sync id="L327"time="00:48:01"/>And so we're taking a principled stand on it, and we strongly believe we're in the right. <Sync id="L328"time="00:48:08"/>And I'm sure they believe that they are, and that's what courts are for. <Sync id="L329"time="00:48:13"/>And we'll let it go with that.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          <Sync id="L330"time="00:48:20"/>I was wondering if you -- if I could just follow up a little bit on iPhone demand. <Sync id="L331"time="00:48:28"/>If I try and adjust for the drawdown in inventory and the extra week last quarter, I think sequentially, iPhones declined about 27% if I make those adjustments. <Sync id="L332"time="00:48:41"/>And that's actually quite a bit lower than the normal seasonality we would see from Q1 to Q2, which is typically closer to 20%. <Sync id="L333"time="00:48:51"/>I understand your comments around China, but your comparison was 40 points easier this quarter relative to last quarter, and the growth rate improved only marginally, I think, when you adjust for the extra week.
<Sync id="L334"time="00:49:05"/>So -- and then you made a final comment around a pause on iPhones. <Sync id="L335"time="00:49:12"/>So I'm wondering if you could maybe elaborate on was the below sequential, at least by my calculation, growth rate in Q2 attributable to a pause. <Sync id="L336"time="00:49:27"/>And can you characterize what you think upgrade rates are doing, perhaps broadly by geography, to help us better understand what might be happening or whether there are competitive dynamics that also are at play here that, again, might be contributing to that pause and that sequential decline that I referenced?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Timothy D. Cook,  Apple Inc. - CEO and Director    [25]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          <Sync id="L337"time="00:49:54"/>A lot of questions there. <Sync id="L338"time="00:49:59"/>Let me give you some color as I see it. <Sync id="L339"time="00:50:06"/>In this quarter, we reduced channel inventory by 1.2 million units. <Sync id="L340"time="00:50:12"/>And so if you look on a year-over-year basis, which is primarily what we look at from a unit point of view because it would have the seasonality embedded in that, we grew sell-through on a year-over-year basis. <Sync id="L341"time="00:50:33"/>Last quarter, I'm sure other folks remember, was a 14-week quarter, and so you sort of have to adjust the rates last quarter to get at what the underlying sell-through growth was. <Sync id="L342"time="00:50:52"/>And so I think that when you do that, you're going to find that, actually, the year-over-year performance is similar between the quarters.
<Sync id="L343"time="00:51:04"/>In terms of upgraders, we saw the largest absolute number of upgraders ever in any 6-month period in the first half of this year, first half of this fiscal year to be precise. <Sync id="L344"time="00:51:22"/>And we saw the largest absolute number of switchers outside of Greater China in the same period that we've ever seen. <Sync id="L345"time="00:51:33"/>And so in 4 of the 5 operating segments, as I think Luca mentioned in his comments, we had very good growth, and it was really propelled by the demand for iPhone 7 Plus, which is growing incredibly fast around the world. <Sync id="L346"time="00:51:59"/>And so that's kind of the color I would add there, and hopefully, some of that are -- is useful for you.

          <Sync id="L351"time="00:52:31"/>As you know, Simona, we do not provide guidance around units and around channel inventory reduction, but our goal is always to have the right amount of weeks of inventory in the channel. <Sync id="L352"time="00:52:47"/>And if you look at our history over the last several years, we have fairly consistently reduced channel inventory in the June quarter, so I think it's a fair expectation to have.

          <Sync id="L353"time="00:53:01"/>And then just for Tim. <Sync id="L354"time="00:53:03"/>Tim, you've been excited about the India market for some time and have made strides in establishing a retail, manufacturing and R&D presence there. <Sync id="L355"time="00:53:12"/>So just curious as you look at that market and the rollout of 4G there, is it reasonable for us to assume that Apple can sell something on the order of 10 million to 20 million iPhones there next year and then grow from there?

          <Sync id="L356"time="00:53:26"/>We make it a point not to forecast by geo. <Sync id="L357"time="00:53:30"/>We just provide a current quarter forecast. <Sync id="L358"time="00:53:34"/>But as hopefully you've seen, as we began to give you more information about India, we've been investing quite a bit. <Sync id="L359"time="00:53:45"/>We have a ton of energy going into the country on a number of fronts. <Sync id="L360"time="00:53:54"/>And it is the third-largest smartphone market in the world today behind the -- China and the United States. <Sync id="L361"time="00:54:04"/>And so we believe, particularly now that a -- the 4G infrastructure is going in the country and it's continuing to be expanded, there is a huge opportunity for Apple there. <Sync id="L362"time="00:54:23"/>And so that's -- that and the demographics of the country is why we're putting so much energy there.

          <Sync id="L364"time="00:54:42"/>Congratulations on returning to growth consistently.  <Sync id="L365"time="00:54:46"/>That's great. <Sync id="L366"time="00:54:47"/>I believe, Tim, in your prepared comments, you mentioned India was growing double digit, which is great. <Sync id="L367"time="00:54:53"/>But I believe if we look at geographic information, India is really underpenetrated from an Apple reception perceptive, but yet they have LTE. <Sync id="L368"time="00:55:03"/>You have the iPhone SE, your lower-priced iPhone. <Sync id="L369"time="00:55:07"/>Do you think that, say, this next 12, 18 months is going to be a turning point? <Sync id="L370"time="00:55:11"/>Or is it more you need to work with the government to have Apple-owned stores or production there? <Sync id="L371"time="00:55:17"/>Or what's it really going to take to get India going along because we think it's just truly a great opportunity?

          <Sync id="L372"time="00:55:24"/>Well, we think it's a great opportunity too, and so we're bringing all the things that we've brought to bear in other markets that we've eventually done well in. <Sync id="L373"time="00:55:41"/>And that's from channel to stores to our ecosystem and so forth. <Sync id="L374"time="00:55:51"/>Phil was just over there opening a developer center last quarter. <Sync id="L375"time="00:55:59"/>And so there's a -- there are a ton of things going on there. <Sync id="L376"time="00:56:04"/>And we agree that we are underpenetrated there. <Sync id="L377"time="00:56:10"/>Our growth rates are good, really good in -- by most people's expectations. <Sync id="L378"time="00:56:19"/>Maybe not mine as much. <Sync id="L379"time="00:56:24"/>And so we're putting a lot of energy in it, just like we have in other geos that eventually wound up producing more and more. <Sync id="L380"time="00:56:34"/>And so I'm very excited about it. <Sync id="L381"time="00:56:39"/>The 4G network investment really began rolling in, in a significant way toward the last quarter of last year, as you know, and -- but they are moving fast. <Sync id="L382"time="00:56:51"/>They're moving at a speed that I have not seen in any other country in the world once they were started. <Sync id="L383"time="00:57:00"/>And it is truly impressive.
