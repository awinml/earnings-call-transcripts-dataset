Operator    [1]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          <Sync id="L180"time="00:30:52"/>The first question will come from Amit Daryanani from Evercore.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Amit Jawaharlaz Daryanani,  Evercore ISI Institutional Equities, Research Division - Senior MD & Fundamental Research Analyst    [2]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          <Sync id="L181"time="00:30:59"/>I guess 2 from me. <Sync id="L182"time="00:31:01"/>First off, could you just talk about, when I think about the September quarter guide, it's implied, I think, up 16% or so sequentially. <Sync id="L183"time="00:31:08"/>Historically, at least in that guide has been in the 10% low double-digit kind of range. <Sync id="L184"time="00:31:12"/>Just maybe help us understand what gives you the confidence for a better-than-seasonal guide in September either from a geo or product basis would be helpful.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Luca Maestri,  Apple Inc. - CFO & Senior VP    [3]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          <Sync id="L185"time="00:31:20"/>Amit, it's Luca. <Sync id="L186"time="00:31:22"/>Of course, this is our best estimate of where we think we will land. <Sync id="L187"time="00:31:25"/>Clearly, we expect to have continued strong growth from the non-iPhone categories. <Sync id="L188"time="00:31:33"/>We have great momentum in Wearables. <Sync id="L189"time="00:31:35"/>We mentioned that we were up almost 50% in the June quarter or actually over 50% in the June quarter. <Sync id="L190"time="00:31:46"/>Our Services business, we set an all-time record in June. <Sync id="L191"time="00:31:50"/>And so these 2 categories have become really important and really large for us. <Sync id="L192"time="00:31:56"/>And so as we continue to grow quickly, that is going to help us as we go through the year. <Sync id="L193"time="00:32:03"/>Keep in mind that the guidance includes an estimated almost $1 billion of foreign exchange headwind for the quarter.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          <Sync id="L194"time="00:32:11"/>Fair enough. <Sync id="L195"time="00:32:15"/>That's really helpful. <Sync id="L196"time="00:32:15"/>And I guess if I just follow up on China, impressed to see the continued recovery you guys are seeing despite all the headlines that are out there. <Sync id="L197"time="00:32:25"/>Just curious what are the few things that are driving the success in China? <Sync id="L198"time="00:32:29"/>And how sustainable do you think those changes are for Apple as you go forward?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Timothy D. Cook,  Apple Inc. - CEO & Director    [5]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          <Sync id="L199"time="00:32:34"/>Yes, Amit. <Sync id="L200"time="00:32:34"/>It's Tim. <Sync id="L201"time="00:32:35"/>I apologize for my voice. <Sync id="L202"time="00:32:36"/>I'm suffering from an allergy. <Sync id="L203"time="00:32:39"/>But what happened last quarter in China was -- it's a confluence of things. <Sync id="L204"time="00:32:46"/>The government stimulus just came in terms of a VAT reduction, a very bold one. <Sync id="L205"time="00:32:53"/>We took some pricing action. <Sync id="L206"time="00:32:56"/>We instituted our trade-in and financing programs in our retail stores and worked with certain channel partners on that as well. <Sync id="L207"time="00:33:08"/>And we're seeing a growing engagement with the broader Apple ecosystem during the quarter.
<Sync id="L208"time="00:33:14"/>And so when you look at it, each of our categories, iPhone, iPad, Mac, Wearables, Services, everything improved sequentially. <Sync id="L209"time="00:33:27"/>So we couldn't be happier with the results or the progress, I should say. <Sync id="L210"time="00:33:34"/>I would point out, as I think I had mentioned in my comments, that we actually grew in constant currency for Greater China, and we grew in Mainland China on a reported basis. <Sync id="L211"time="00:33:49"/>So there's several things going on there that are quite positive.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Operator    [6]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          <Sync id="L212"time="00:33:58"/>The next question will come from Shannon Cross with Cross Research.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Shannon Siemsen Cross,  Cross Research LLC - Co-Founder, Principal & Analyst    [7]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          <Sync id="L213"time="00:34:06"/>Can you talk a bit about what's going on within Services, some of the puts and takes? <Sync id="L214"time="00:34:12"/>I know Luca, you gave us some color in terms of the growth rates in that. <Sync id="L215"time="00:34:16"/>But I'm just curious as -- and I know you won't talk about future products, but as you think about the opportunities, you think about what you've got now and in the future and then some of the -- what's been going on with China in that, is there something that could reaccelerate or again the 18% on a constant currency basis is obviously quite strong. <Sync id="L216"time="00:34:38"/>But how are you thinking about it?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Luca Maestri,  Apple Inc. - CFO & Senior VP    [8]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          <Sync id="L217"time="00:34:40"/>Yes. <Sync id="L218"time="00:34:40"/>I think it's important to start with that 18% in constant currencies, Shannon. <Sync id="L219"time="00:34:47"/>Our reported results are on a normalized basis, removing the onetime item from last year, was 15%. <Sync id="L220"time="00:34:56"/>Clearly, FX plays a role around the world, 300 basis points of FX impact during the June quarter. <Sync id="L221"time="00:35:04"/>In spite of that, it was an all-time record revenue. <Sync id="L222"time="00:35:11"/>Our installed base continues to grow. <Sync id="L223"time="00:35:14"/>It's growing in every geography and it's growing across all our major product categories, and that is very, very important for the Services -- for the Services business. 
<Sync id="L224"time="00:35:28"/>I would say -- I'll give you a bit more color around 2 offsetting factors around this performance during the June quarter. <Sync id="L225"time="00:35:37"/>On one side, the App Store, I mentioned in my prepared remarks that growth accelerated sequentially. <Sync id="L226"time="00:35:46"/>We had double-digit growth on the App Store in every geography. <Sync id="L227"time="00:35:52"/>In China, we saw significant acceleration. <Sync id="L228"time="00:35:57"/>As you know, we tend to monetize in China on the App Store through game titles, and the government has approved a few key game titles during the quarter that has helped our performance there. 
<Sync id="L229"time="00:36:13"/>On the other side, AppleCare. <Sync id="L230"time="00:36:17"/>I mentioned AppleCare was an all-time record in June so a really strong performance. <Sync id="L231"time="00:36:22"/>But our growth has decelerated in AppleCare due to factors that we fully expected because we are comping this expansion of our coverage for AppleCare that we've had, we've had significant success during the last 18 to 24 months in really broadening our coverage of AppleCare around the world with some key partners, carriers and resellers. <Sync id="L232"time="00:36:52"/>And obviously, as we go through the year, those comps become a bit more difficult. 
<Sync id="L233"time="00:37:01"/>Having said all that, you know that we've given ourselves a couple of targets and we feel very confident about reaching those targets. <Sync id="L234"time="00:37:11"/>The first one is that we wanted to double the size of the Services business from our fiscal '16 to 2020. <Sync id="L235"time="00:37:18"/>We are on our way there. <Sync id="L236"time="00:37:22"/>Paid subscriptions is another target. <Sync id="L237"time="00:37:23"/>It's important to us. <Sync id="L238"time="00:37:25"/>It's an important way for us to monetize our ecosystem. <Sync id="L239"time="00:37:30"/>We set a target of surpassing 0.5 billion paid subscriptions on the ecosystem during 2020. <Sync id="L240"time="00:37:39"/>We're already at 420 million now. <Sync id="L241"time="00:37:41"/>So we feel confident there. 
<Sync id="L242"time="00:37:43"/>And of course, as you mentioned, we're very excited about the fact that we're going to be launching new services soon. <Sync id="L243"time="00:37:50"/>As Tim said, we're starting the rollout of Apple Card in August. <Sync id="L244"time="00:37:57"/>And there's 2 more very important services that we're going to be adding to our portfolio during the fall. <Sync id="L245"time="00:38:03"/>One is Apple Arcade, which is our gaming subscription service, and of course, Apple TV+, which is our video streaming service. <Sync id="L246"time="00:38:14"/>So obviously, these services will help us carry on with the momentum that we have in Services.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Shannon Siemsen Cross,  Cross Research LLC - Co-Founder, Principal & Analyst    [9]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          <Sync id="L247"time="00:38:23"/>Great. <Sync id="L248"time="00:38:23"/>And this is probably for you too as well, Luca. <Sync id="L249"time="00:38:25"/>Can you talk about gross margin? <Sync id="L250"time="00:38:28"/>The guidance was pretty solid. <Sync id="L251"time="00:38:30"/>Obviously, there are various things that are at play here. <Sync id="L252"time="00:38:33"/>I know you mentioned the $1 billion worth of top line impact, I think, from currency next quarter. <Sync id="L253"time="00:38:37"/>But maybe if you can kind of talk about what went into your gross margin guidance?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Luca Maestri,  Apple Inc. - CFO & Senior VP    [10]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          <Sync id="L254"time="00:38:41"/>Yes. <Sync id="L255"time="00:38:42"/>So of course, Shannon, as you've seen, our guidance for margin is 50 basis points higher than the guidance that we had given for June. <Sync id="L256"time="00:38:52"/>I would say on the positive, we expect to benefit from leverage, as you've seen from our revenue guidance, and from cost savings because, as you know, the commodity environment is fairly favorable right now. <Sync id="L257"time="00:39:08"/>On the negative side, the headwind on gross margins on a year-over-year basis from foreign exchange is about 100 basis points. <Sync id="L258"time="00:39:17"/>And so we need to keep that in mind, but we feel pretty good about the guidance we provided.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Operator    [11]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          <Sync id="L259"time="00:39:28"/>Our next question will come from Katy Huberty with Morgan Stanley.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Kathryn Lynn Huberty,  Morgan Stanley, Research Division - MD and Research Analyst    [12]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          <Sync id="L260"time="00:39:34"/>I'd like to go back to the discussion around strength in China in the quarter and understand what linearity looked like. <Sync id="L261"time="00:39:42"/>I asked because there was some industry data around the smartphone market in China that seemed to deteriorate in the month of June, the App Store data deteriorated a little bit in June. <Sync id="L262"time="00:39:53"/>And just curious if that's something you saw in the business, and if it at all informs your outlook around the pace of the China business as you go into September.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Timothy D. Cook,  Apple Inc. - CEO & Director    [13]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          <Sync id="L263"time="00:40:06"/>Katy, it's Tim. <Sync id="L264"time="00:40:08"/>We obviously took into account all of the information that we had and coming out with the guidance, including linearity across last quarter and how this quarter has started. <Sync id="L265"time="00:40:21"/>And so we've obviously looked at that in quite much detail.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Kathryn Lynn Huberty,  Morgan Stanley, Research Division - MD and Research Analyst    [14]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          <Sync id="L266"time="00:40:30"/>And then just on the App Store, appreciate there's not a lot of detail out around exact timing and even some pricing of the new services. <Sync id="L267"time="00:40:39"/>But how should we think about the new services that launched in March impacting the overall Services growth? <Sync id="L268"time="00:40:51"/>Does that start to benefit the model in the back half of this calendar year? <Sync id="L269"time="00:40:58"/>Or will the impact be more longer term in nature and really show up in 2020?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Luca Maestri,  Apple Inc. - CFO & Senior VP    [15]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          <Sync id="L270"time="00:41:06"/>Katy, let me just talk about the new services that we've announced in March and then also about the timing of how we get to revenue, right? <Sync id="L271"time="00:41:16"/>We've announced Apple News+, and this is the service that is available for consumers right now. <Sync id="L272"time="00:41:26"/>We've announced our channel service, which has also become available a few weeks ago. <Sync id="L273"time="00:41:32"/>The other 3 services, the Card is launching in August, the gaming service and the video service are starting in the fall. <Sync id="L274"time="00:41:41"/>Keep in mind for all these services, there's a trial period upfront. <Sync id="L275"time="00:41:45"/>There's going to be different trial periods, we'll see what they look like. <Sync id="L276"time="00:41:49"/>So the road to monetization takes some time. <Sync id="L277"time="00:41:53"/>Obviously, all of them will add to our base and will help us with growth rates as we get into next year.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Operator    [16]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          <Sync id="L278"time="00:42:04"/>That question will come from Krish Sankar with Cowen and Company.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Krish Sankar,  Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division - MD & Senior Research Analyst    [17]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          <Sync id="L279"time="00:42:12"/>I have 2 of them. <Sync id="L280"time="00:42:13"/>First one, on the iPhone trade-in program, how effective was it and what percentage of iPhone sales came from the trade-ins? <Sync id="L281"time="00:42:22"/>And are there any other geographies where you're left to roll it out? <Sync id="L282"time="00:42:24"/>And then I have a follow-up.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Timothy D. Cook,  Apple Inc. - CEO & Director    [18]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          <Sync id="L283"time="00:42:27"/>It's Tim. <Sync id="L284"time="00:42:27"/>In retail, it was quite successful. <Sync id="L285"time="00:42:31"/>We got going in a larger way during that quarter. <Sync id="L286"time="00:42:36"/>We were pretty much just ramping in the previous quarter. <Sync id="L287"time="00:42:41"/>And trade-in, as a percentage of their total sales, is significant and financing is a key element of it. <Sync id="L288"time="00:42:50"/>Those 2 things in the aggregate led retail -- the combination of retail and online, we -- to short form that as retail, are Apple Store, led to growth in June. <Sync id="L289"time="00:43:02"/>And so we feel very, very good about our trajectory. <Sync id="L290"time="00:43:06"/>We are obviously taking those programs and advocating those more widely. <Sync id="L291"time="00:43:13"/>And that is at different levels of implementation throughout different geographies because we're working with our carrier partners on those and retail partners.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Krish Sankar,  Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division - MD & Senior Research Analyst    [19]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          <Sync id="L292"time="00:43:29"/>Got it, got it. <Sync id="L293"time="00:43:30"/>That's very helpful, Tim. <Sync id="L294"time="00:43:31"/>And then a follow-up for you, a much longer-term question. <Sync id="L295"time="00:43:34"/>I understand we're in the very early innings of the Services growth story. <Sync id="L296"time="00:43:39"/>Is there a way to think about it down the road that 3 or 5 years down the road, would the Services growth be focused or will it still be tethered to the hardware of the iPhone? <Sync id="L297"time="00:43:49"/>Or do you think at some point down the road, Services would be independent by itself and not really tied to your hardware installed base?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Timothy D. Cook,  Apple Inc. - CEO & Director    [20]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          <Sync id="L298"time="00:43:57"/>Well, there are elements today that are not necessarily tethered to iPhone, right? <Sync id="L299"time="00:44:02"/>We have other products where people are both purchasing things, they're watching Apple TV. <Sync id="L300"time="00:44:11"/>We offer Apple Music on Android, and so there's a series of things that are outside of that. <Sync id="L301"time="00:44:18"/>And so we'll see what we do in the future. <Sync id="L302"time="00:44:20"/>I don't want to really get into that. 
<Sync id="L303"time="00:44:24"/>But more broadly, to answer your question about growth as we go forward, the way I see it is we have the strongest hardware portfolio ever. <Sync id="L304"time="00:44:35"/>We've got new products on the way. <Sync id="L305"time="00:44:37"/>The pipeline is full of great new stuff, both on the product and services side. <Sync id="L306"time="00:44:44"/>We're very fortunate and work very hard to have loyal customers and to continue attracting an impressive number of switchers. <Sync id="L307"time="00:44:54"/>The installed base is growing, hit a new record. <Sync id="L308"time="00:44:57"/>That's obviously good. <Sync id="L309"time="00:44:59"/>And it hit a new record across all geographies and across all categories. <Sync id="L310"time="00:45:06"/>And so this is a really good thing.
<Sync id="L311"time="00:45:11"/>And we've got the Wearables area that is doing extremely well. <Sync id="L312"time="00:45:18"/>We stuck with that when others perhaps didn't and really put a lot of energy into this and a lot of R&D and are in a very good position today to keep playing out the what's next there.
<Sync id="L313"time="00:45:35"/>At the same time, on the market side, we have emerging markets where we have low penetration. <Sync id="L314"time="00:45:43"/>And in -- during the quarter, tactically, emerging markets had a bit of a rebound. <Sync id="L315"time="00:45:48"/>In fact, on a constant currency basis, we actually grew slightly in emerging markets. <Sync id="L316"time="00:45:55"/>We still declined on a reported basis. <Sync id="L317"time="00:45:59"/>India bounced back. <Sync id="L318"time="00:46:01"/>During the quarter, we returned to growth there. <Sync id="L319"time="00:46:04"/>We're very happy with that. <Sync id="L320"time="00:46:05"/>We grew in Brazil as well. 
<Sync id="L321"time="00:46:09"/>We're also continuing to focus on the enterprise market. <Sync id="L322"time="00:46:12"/>Luca mentioned some of this in his comments, and we think that continues to be a big opportunity for us. <Sync id="L323"time="00:46:19"/>And then we've got lots of what I would call core technology kinds of things like augmented reality, where we're placing big bets, and I think we have a big future in addition to the health kinds of things that may fall out of the Watch. <Sync id="L324"time="00:46:38"/>And so hopefully, that kind of this gives you a view over the total. <Sync id="L325"time="00:46:42"/>And so we're focusing on products and services and there will be some services that aren't hooked and some that are hooked not on current period sales are mostly -- very much services are rarely connected on that today or at least not a high percentage by any means. <Sync id="L326"time="00:47:07"/>They're more correlated to the installed base, the active installed base and also the level of transacting customers that are there and the amount per customer, which relates also to the offering that we have.

Operator    [21]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          <Sync id="L327"time="00:47:31"/>Next, we'll go to Wamsi Mohan with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Wamsi Mohan,  BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division - Director    [22]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          <Sync id="L328"time="00:47:37"/>Tim, the China trade situation remains sort of fluid over here and recently -- more recently, you asked for some tariff exemptions. <Sync id="L329"time="00:47:45"/>We're not granted those. <Sync id="L330"time="00:47:46"/>How are you thinking about the longer-term footprint for manufacturing? <Sync id="L331"time="00:47:51"/>And can you talk about any potential alternatives that you've looked at and considered in moving parts of production potentially out of China? <Sync id="L332"time="00:47:57"/>And I have a follow-up.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Timothy D. Cook,  Apple Inc. - CEO & Director    [23]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          <Sync id="L333"time="00:47:57"/>Yes. <Sync id="L334"time="00:47:58"/>I know there's been a lot of speculation around the topic of different moves and so forth. <Sync id="L335"time="00:48:05"/>I wouldn't put a lot of stock into those, if I were you. <Sync id="L336"time="00:48:09"/>The way that I view this is the vast majority of our products are kind of made everywhere. <Sync id="L337"time="00:48:15"/>There's a significant level of content from the United States and a lot from Japan to Korea to China and the European Union also contributes a fair amount. <Sync id="L338"time="00:48:29"/>And so that's the nature of a global supply chain. <Sync id="L339"time="00:48:35"/>I think -- largely, I think that will carry the day in the future as well. <Sync id="L340"time="00:48:45"/>In terms of the exclusions, we've been making the Mac Pro in the U.S. We want to continue to doing that. <Sync id="L341"time="00:48:53"/>And so we're working and investing currently in capacity to do so because we want to continue to be here. <Sync id="L342"time="00:49:05"/>And so that's what's behind the exclusions. <Sync id="L343"time="00:49:07"/>And so we're explaining that and hope for a positive outcome.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Wamsi Mohan,  BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division - Director    [24]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          <Sync id="L344"time="00:49:20"/>And there's -- Luca, maybe for you, there's been some significant destocking of inventory in the first calendar half of this year in iPhone. <Sync id="L345"time="00:49:28"/>Can you comment about the broader channel inventory levels, where you are in your typical ranges, especially given the comment around June iPhone sales being quite strong? <Sync id="L346"time="00:49:37"/>And do you expect anything atypical in channel inventory dynamics in the September quarter?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Luca Maestri,  Apple Inc. - CFO & Senior VP    [25]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          <Sync id="L347"time="00:49:44"/>Yes, Wamsi. <Sync id="L348"time="00:49:44"/>As you know, we're not getting into this topic very much, but I think I can give you some color here. <Sync id="L349"time="00:49:52"/>You know that in general, we decreased our inventory during the March quarter and the June quarter. <Sync id="L350"time="00:50:01"/>That has been traditionally what we've done. <Sync id="L351"time="00:50:04"/>This year, we reduced channel inventory for iPhone slightly more than last year. <Sync id="L352"time="00:50:11"/>And that is true in total, and it's true for Greater China as well. <Sync id="L353"time="00:50:15"/>So we feel very good about our channel inventory ranges as we get into the September quarter. <Sync id="L354"time="00:50:22"/>I hope that helps you with that.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Operator    [26]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          <Sync id="L355"time="00:50:31"/>Our next question comes from Jim Suva with Citigroup.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Jim Suva,  Citigroup Inc, Research Division - Director    [27]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          <Sync id="L356"time="00:50:37"/>The first question is probably for Tim and the second one for Luca, and I'll ask them at the same time so you can pick and choose whichever one you want to answer, first and second. <Sync id="L357"time="00:50:45"/>But the first question, Tim. <Sync id="L358"time="00:50:47"/>Regarding the installed base comment you've made, which is quite encouraging, but yet when you look at the iPhone revenue year-over-year, the past several quarters has been down. <Sync id="L359"time="00:50:58"/>Can you help us bridge the gap of how is the installed base growing? 
<Sync id="L360"time="00:51:03"/>Is it mostly because like secondary users are the new ones coming into the system as people are holding their phones longer? <Sync id="L361"time="00:51:12"/>And what does that user typically bring  in with them or something unique relative to what we historically know? <Sync id="L362"time="00:51:19"/>And then for Luca, you've been investing a lot, a lot, lot, lot and a lot of these services are now coming to pass, whether it be AppleCare, Apple cloud, all these Wearables, and soon Apple Pay and Arcade. <Sync id="L363"time="00:51:32"/>Are we at a point where now, a lot of harvesting is going to happen? <Sync id="L364"time="00:51:35"/>Or do you kind of continue these relatively same investments that you've been doing for the future strategy?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Timothy D. Cook,  Apple Inc. - CEO & Director    [28]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          <Sync id="L365"time="00:51:43"/>Okay. <Sync id="L366"time="00:51:43"/>Jim, it's Tim. <Sync id="L367"time="00:51:45"/>I'll start with your installed base question. <Sync id="L368"time="00:51:47"/>Installed base is a function of upgrades and the time between those. <Sync id="L369"time="00:51:56"/>It's a function of the number of switchers coming into the iOS, macOS and so forth tents. <Sync id="L370"time="00:52:06"/>It's a function of the robustness of the secondary market, which we think overwhelmingly hits incremental customer. <Sync id="L371"time="00:52:15"/>And it's a function still in the emerging markets and somewhat developed markets, to a lesser degree, of people new that -- they're buying their first smartphone. <Sync id="L372"time="00:52:28"/>There are still quite a few people in the world in that category.
<Sync id="L373"time="00:52:32"/>And so the reason that the installed base doesn't correlate to the 90-day clock is that what's happening underneath the numbers is switchers are still a very key piece of what's going on. <Sync id="L374"time="00:52:48"/>The secondary market is very key, and we're doing programs, et cetera, to try to increase that because we think we'd wind up hitting a customer that we don't hit in another way. <Sync id="L375"time="00:53:05"/>And the upgrades, where people are holding on to their device a bit longer than they were, they're staying in the ecosystem. <Sync id="L376"time="00:53:15"/>And then you have the people in the new category as well. <Sync id="L377"time="00:53:19"/>And so that's sort of the equation. <Sync id="L378"time="00:53:22"/>I don't want to go into the specific numbers, but I think you can see readily, mathematically, how the installed base is growing in an environment where the iPhone revenue is declining within a 90-day kind of window.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Luca Maestri,  Apple Inc. - CFO & Senior VP    [29]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          <Sync id="L379"time="00:53:42"/>And Jim, on OpEx, obviously, it's very important for us to continue to invest in the business, particularly on the R&D side because we always want to bring more innovation into the market. <Sync id="L380"time="00:53:55"/>We want to improve the user experience and differentiate our products and services in the marketplace. <Sync id="L381"time="00:54:01"/>So we will continue to do that. 
<Sync id="L382"time="00:54:05"/>There are some types of investments, of course, that are very strategic for us and they will have long-term implications. <Sync id="L383"time="00:54:13"/>You've seen the announcement that we made around the Intel acquisition. <Sync id="L384"time="00:54:17"/>Very important strategically for us. <Sync id="L385"time="00:54:20"/>It requires upfront investment, of course. <Sync id="L386"time="00:54:24"/>As you've seen from this quarter and also from the past, we will continue to run our SG&A portion of OpEx tightly. <Sync id="L387"time="00:54:34"/>We will -- of course, we'll continue to invest in marketing and advertising. <Sync id="L388"time="00:54:39"/>We talked about a lot of new services that we are launching during the fall and Apple Card the next month. <Sync id="L389"time="00:54:48"/>Obviously, they will require the appropriate level of marketing and advertising as we launch them to the general public.
<Sync id="L390"time="00:55:00"/>When you look in total at where we are in terms of our expense-to-revenue ratio for operating expenses, you know quite well that we are extremely competitive relative to other tech companies. <Sync id="L391"time="00:55:16"/>So we want to continue to be competitive and at the same time, we will not under invest in the business.

Operator    [30]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          <Sync id="L392"time="00:55:24"/>The next question will come from Samik Chatterjee with JPMorgan.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Samik Chatterjee,  JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division - Analyst    [31]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          <Sync id="L393"time="00:55:33"/>I just wanted to start off with the announcement of the WWDC around the independent App Stores for the Watch and the iPads. <Sync id="L394"time="00:55:45"/>What level of interest have you seen from developers and how are they thinking about the ability to monetize services independently on those App Stores? <Sync id="L395"time="00:55:53"/>And how does it help you position Wearables more formally into the health and fitness category?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Timothy D. Cook,  Apple Inc. - CEO & Director    [32]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          <Sync id="L396"time="00:56:00"/>We're seeing good interest across virtually everything that we announced at WWDC. <Sync id="L397"time="00:56:05"/>I couldn't be happier with the developer tools around ARKit and AR in general that I went through earlier. <Sync id="L398"time="00:56:21"/>Lots of interest there. <Sync id="L399"time="00:56:21"/>Lots of interest from the watch App Store to the Catalyst that will be released with macOS Catalina, which allows developers quickly to port a iOS app to the Mac. <Sync id="L400"time="00:56:33"/>We think this is huge and so great for the user experience. <Sync id="L401"time="00:56:38"/>And so you look at all of these and all of the things that I talked about earlier and I couldn't be happier with the reception that we're getting and the work that is going on behind the scenes right now to ready -- for the developers readying their apps for the fall.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Samik Chatterjee,  JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division - Analyst    [33]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          <Sync id="L402"time="00:56:54"/>Got it. <Sync id="L403"time="00:56:54"/>If I can just follow up on the China market. <Sync id="L404"time="00:57:02"/>One of the things that we're looking at is with these -- going into the new year into 2020, there'll be a lot of 5G phones launching in that market from the Android players. <Sync id="L405"time="00:57:12"/>How you're thinking about the competitive landscape there as you enter next year?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Timothy D. Cook,  Apple Inc. - CEO & Director    [34]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          <Sync id="L406"time="00:57:18"/>We don't comment on future products. <Sync id="L407"time="00:57:22"/>With respect to 5G, it's -- I think most people would tell you it's -- we're in sort of the extremely early, early innings of it and even more so on a global basis. <Sync id="L408"time="00:57:36"/>So we couldn't be more proud of what our lineup is and we're excited about the great pipeline of both hardware and software, and we won't trade our position for anyone's.
